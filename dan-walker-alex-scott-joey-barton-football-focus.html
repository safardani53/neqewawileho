The former Football Focus host had previously had a public spat with the ex-England defender about the future of the BBC Saturday lunchtime show.
But he turned from critic to supporter amid Barton's prolonged misogynistic Twitter rant. The former midfielder has piled in on the likes of Scott and Laura Woods this week, inexplicably claiming women pundits “shouldn’t be talking with any kind of authority” on men's football."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

No wonder it’s getting canned.</p><p>"Well done to all involved. Another flagship destroyed by The Tokens."</p><p>And then following <a href=#>news of Question of Sport being pulled by the BBC</a>, Walker expressed his sadness at the show coming to an end.</p><p>He tweeted: "Really sad to read the news about Question of Sport.

There is definitely still a winning format in there somewhere."</p><p><a href=#>Barton</a> replied: "‘Wokeness’ killed it. Poor quality guests. Standards dropped. So sad to watch it slowly deteriorate.</p><p>"It was essential viewing as a kid who loved sports. Just like Soccer AM.</p><p>"I’m hearing they’re about to do for Football Focus next? @AlexScott?

Barton’s attitude is reminiscent of the one that women should stay at home, clean the house, look after the kids and not dabble in men’s business.</p><p>"There are many that still think like that.
