After <a href=#><strong>Luke Gulbranson</strong></a> revealed his interest in newly single <a href=#><strong>Ashley Darby</strong></a> at the<a href=#>&nbsp;<i>Summer House&nbsp;</i></a><a href=#>BravoCon 2022 panel</a>, it seems there may be a spark brewing.</p><p class=p1>“Well, we did exchange numbers. So we’re texting and we’re just chatting it up,” the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Real Housewives of Potomac</a>&nbsp;</i>star, 34, exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>at <a href=#>BravoCon</a> on Saturday, October 15. “But you know, we’ll see. He’s a really nice guy and he’s very cute. That helps a lot.”</p><p class=p1>While Ashley <a href=#>played coy about a prospective romance</a> with the 38-year-old Bravo personality, she has been single since April when <a href=#>she and estranged husband <strong>Michael Darby</strong> announced their separation</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rhops-ashley-darby-and-summer-houses-luke-gulbranson-have-exchanged-numbers-hes-very-cute.jpg><p class=p1>“I just barely touched the surface,” the Maryland native told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>about <a href=#>entering the dating pool amid her breakup</a>. “I haven’t really ventured into it yet and I have gone on a date or two, but it’s still really foreign to me, especially dating with texting and all of that because when I started dating Michael 11 or 12 years ago now, it was just such a different time.”</p><p class=p1>She added: “The <a href=#>way that people interacted with each other</a> was so different. So I had to learn a lot. You know, I gotta learn and, like, if someone asks me to put them on Snapchat or if I have a Snap, I’m just like, ‘Get outta my face.’”</p><p class=p1>Ashley and the 62-year-old businessman <a href=#>share two sons</a>, who they plan to amicably coparent amid their divorce.</p><p class=p1>“It’s certainly not easy and it takes a lot of just a reminder of the good times that we had so that I don’t focus on what we are now and that way we can coparent because that’s really what we’re doing. The focus is always my kids,” the Zengem by Ashley founder explained to&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>while attending the New York City convention. “I was really surprised with the ease that we were able to put our kids first <a href=#>even if we have a disagreement and we have some words</a> or exchange that are really rough, it’s like we instantly flip the switch and we turn into the parents of Dean and Dylan. So that makes me actually respect him even more.”</p><p class=p1>While it’s been “a while” since Ashley was in the dating game, her potential connection with Luke has continued to heat up BravoCon.</p><p class=p1>“Well, we have to go on a date or something first,” the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Summer House</a>&nbsp;</i>personality joked to&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>on Saturday during a joint interview with costar <a href=#><strong>Andrea Denver</strong></a>. “We had [a] friendly conversation on our way leaving [the convention] last night. We just chatted.”</p><p class=p1>While the twosome may have downplayed any romantic spark, the 31-year-old Italy native said their exchange was “actually really cute.”</p><p class=p1>Luke — who has previously been linked to&nbsp;<i>Summer House&nbsp;</i>castmates <a href=#><strong>Hannah Berner</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Danielle Olivera</strong></a> and<a href=#><strong> Ciara Miller</strong></a> — even met up with Ashley at the TV network’s After Dark party on Saturday, where they posed for an <a href=#>Instagram</a> photo together.&nbsp;“What in the bravo verse and why am I so here for this!!!!!!” an Instagram user replied, as another proclaimed they were already composing a wedding speech.</p><p class=p1>While Ashley and Luke are <a href=#>open to seeing how things go</a>, her&nbsp;<i>RHOP&nbsp;</i>costar <a href=#><strong>Gizelle Bryant</strong></a> is not on the same page.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“No! I’m not here for that,” Gizelle, 52, told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>at BravoCon. “Just for the record, Luke: I’m not here for that.
