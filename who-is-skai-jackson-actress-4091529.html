She was on the Disney Channel.</strong> Skai <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>rose to fame</a> after playing the sassy and mischievous Zuri Ross on the shows&nbsp;Jessie&nbsp;and again on&nbsp;Bunk’d. Originating the role at just nine years old, we watched Skai’s Zuri grow up in front of her eyes as she entered her teenage years! The character also appeared in crossover specials with Good Luck Charlie and K.C. Undercover.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/skai-jackson-5-things-to-know-disney-abc-embed-01.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10><strong>2. She’s a published author.</strong> Zuri released her debut book <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Reach for the Skai: How to Inspire, Empower, and Clapback</a> in 2019. The inspirational memoir includes several lessons about life that Skai has learned over the years, especially when it comes to girl power, clapping back and loving yourself. “Take ten deep breaths. Never tweet while you’re angry; you’ll probably regret it later,” she writes about <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>clapping back</a>, adding, “Get sassy. Never use curse words, foul language, or racial slurs, or say anything about a person’s appearance. Just work with being smart-mouthed.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13><strong>3. She’s been in music videos.</strong> Skai appeared in <strong>Lil Nas X</strong>‘s viral video for “<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Panini</a>” in 2019! In the video, Skai can’t escape the rapping sensation.

She’s from New York.</strong> Skai was born on April 8, 2002 in <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>New York City</a> to Kiya Cole and Jacob Jackson. “Have you ever asked your parents the story behind your name? When I did, my mom told me somethings that really surprised me,” Skai wrote in her memoir. “When my mom was young, she got sick and her doctor said she might not be able to get pregnant….After years of praying for a girl, my mom miraculously got pregnant with me. She wanted to celebrate by giving her daughter a special name. A friend had mentioned the name Sky, and my mom loved it!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-17><strong>5. She had a feud with Bhad Bhabie.</strong> The <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>feud started</a> when Skai had expressed a romantic interest in Danielle “Bhad Bhabie” Bregoli’s ex-boyfriend <strong>NBA YoungBoy</strong>. “Can somebody hook me up with YB,” Skai wrote. “He just so fine to me… Lord.” Bhad Bhabie wasn’t having it, and quickly dubbed Skai a “Disney Thot.” The situation ultimately escalated with Skai getting a restraining order.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2LArK3IZqGam5uovK95wJyrq52jqHp1fJhqbGtxXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
