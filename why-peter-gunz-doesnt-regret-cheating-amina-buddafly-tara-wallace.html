However, they have been somewhat split for a year, as seen on season 7 of Love & Hip Hop: New York. She moved to LA while he resides in the Big Apple.

I have these two beautiful babies but it was terrible to do that. Neither <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>one of the [ladies], very beautiful, smart, deserve that</a>. If it were my brother or sister I would, I would be disgusted and angry at me, as her family can be sometimes, especially sometimes Tara’s family, you know. These are people I used to be with at Thanksgiving dinners with and they won’t even look at me any more. That’s hard. But at the end of the day, it’s hard for me to regret the end result.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“I was cheating, I won’t even lie,” Peter confessed to us EXCLUSIVELY. “I’m a terrible husband, terrible boyfriend, I <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>can’t even deny that</a>.” The reality star desperately tried to salvage his relationship with Amina on Marriage Bootcamp, since he couldn’t decide between the ladies. Despite her pain and heartbreaks, Amina still believes he has good intentions. “On TV, people don’t see how much of a good person he truly is,” she gushed, adding, “When you meet him in person and you’re around him, that’s the guy you get to know.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Watch Peter and Amina on&nbsp;Marriage Bootcamp: Reality Stars on WEtv, every Friday night at 9 PM ET!</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, are you surprised by Peter’s comments?
