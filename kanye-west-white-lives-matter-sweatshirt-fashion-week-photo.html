To get attention for his fashion show,” one fan <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wrote</a>. Suit Up News host&nbsp;<strong>Exavier Pope&nbsp;</strong>similarly called out Kanye for the shirt. “There’s no way to spin that shirt positively, even if it’s parody. It’s begging for attention,” he wrote. Another <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweeted</a> that it was unsurprising given Kanye’s support for former President <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Donald Trump.</a>&nbsp;</strong>“You lot are shocked at Kanye wearing a ‘White Lives Matter’ shirt like the man didn’t support Trump,” they wrote.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Kanye-West-White-Lives-Matter-Shirt-Spl-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11>While the sweatshirt is extremely controversial, Kanye took part in<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Black Lives Matter protests</a> in June 2020, when the marches were held across the nation following the murder of <strong>George Floyd.&nbsp;</strong>He was seen at one of the protests in Chicago, and he also <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>donated $2 million</a> to help the families of George Floyd,&nbsp;<strong>Breonna Taylor&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Ahmaud Arbery.&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Kanye has been no stranger to making questionable political statements, including his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>run for president in 2020</a>. The My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy rapper has said that he would “absolutely” <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>run for president again</a> in a September interview with&nbsp;Good Morning America.&nbsp;“That time wasn’t in God’s time,” he said while reflecting on his failed campaign two years ago.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/kanye-west-white-lives-matter-hoodi-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-13>Besides the fashion show, Kanye has been seen out and about in Paris for different events, like<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> the Burberry Show,</a> surrounding Fashion Week.
