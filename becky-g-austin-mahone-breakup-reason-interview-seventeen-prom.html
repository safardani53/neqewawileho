It was only fair for me to set the story straight after we broke up. I was with someone who was really amazing and inspiring, and everything was right about us except the timing. We had so many dreams and aspirations before we started dating and you can’t forget those. Honestly, it sucked really bad, but he’s so awesome and there’s no bad blood,” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The songstress also opened up about her prom night. “We went with another couple and we did the whole cheesy picture thing with the parents being all emotional and excited for us. That was really cool. The party was on a boat, and then afterward we drove around in the limo and went to In-and-Out—I got my usual Number Two with no onions, extra toasted buns, and a Dr. Pepper. I had to be home by 1 a.m., so there was no time to party afterward,” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>While Becky G might be a major rockstar, she’s also still very down-to-earth. “I can be gone on tour for weeks, come home, and still be expected to wash the dishes, clean the bathroom, and babysit my siblings,” she said. “It gives me a sense of normality because almost everything else in my life isn’t normal.”<img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Not only does Becky G open up in the mag, but she also shows off a slew of gorgeous prom dresses!
