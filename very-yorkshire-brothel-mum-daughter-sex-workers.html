It could be a cosy coffee morning in a suburban home - but the women here are escorts and this is Sheffield’s busiest brothel, City Sauna, run by mother and daughter team Kath and Jenni.
Between endless cups of tea, the duo – who feature in ITV’s A Very Yorkshire Brothel, which airs tonight at 10."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

So brothels – classed as two or more women working together – are illegal, making the City Sauna's activities against the law.</p><p>“You never know if you’re here from one day to another. The police can close you down at any time, and so can the council,” Kath, 56, says.</p><p>“You hope for the best every time you open up and when you lock up every night it could be the last time.</p><p>“People are always fascinated by what it’s like to work here. But to me it’s just like working in a chip shop.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/NINTCHDBPICT000542766308-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/NINTCHDBPICT000542765941.jpg><h2>‘Being a sex worker makes me a good mum’</h2><p>The pebble-dashed white building – one of 12 massage parlours in Sheffield’s unofficial red light district – stands alone in the centre of the busy Attercliffe road.</p><p>Inside, the reception is welcoming, with huge comfy seats - and the bedrooms are bright and clean, with fresh towels and flowers laid out on the crisp linen of the bed.</p><p>“People have a perception of brothels as dirty, dark, and seedy, with people hanging around outside,” says Jenni, 32. “Ours is more like a community centre.”</p><p>Clients can choose from having sex with the six permanent staff including Lilly (“a lovely curvy size 18 with a 36C bust” and Alice (“a curvy size 14/16) who operate on a rota system.</p><p>But the first episode introduces travelling escort Autumn - “a natural redhead with a 36EE bust - who who moves around from parlour to parlour, spending two or three days at each.</p><p>A working mum in her early 30s, she turned to sex work to put food on the table after a break up left her in debt.</p><p>“I lost my job, with kids at home and I decided to try something a bit different,” says the former receptionist.</p><p>“And I loved it. It allows me to be at home with my kids four days and then work three days.”</p><p>Autumn, who has been a sex worker for 13 years, says her oldest child now knows what she does.</p><p>“My family know what I do, my partner knows what I do,” she adds, adding that she told him as soon as they met and he just sees it as a job like any other.</p><p>“What I do for a living doesn’t make me less of a person or less of a mother and I don’t think anybody has the right to tell me I can’t feed, clothe and look after my children. That’s my job as a mum.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/NINTCHDBPICT000542766334-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/NINTCHDBPICT000542766307.jpg><h2>'Panic buttons and CCTV in rooms'</h2><p>But with brothels only accounting for five percent of the sex trade in the UK, safe places for sex workers are rare and the introduction of <a href=#>Universal Credit has seen a rise in women turning to prostitution.</a></p><p>According to the show, 70 per cent of sex workers were previously employed in healthcare, education or charities and a third have university degrees.</p><p>Kath and Jenni were horrified at the conditions of the prostitutes in Leeds, where a “managed area” - where girls could sell sex on the street between 7pm and 7am without fear of arrest - was put in place in 2014 in an attempt to prevent violence against sex workers.</p><p>But local residents say the girls then have "nowhere to go" with their clients and are still "dicing with death" by getting into strange cars.</p><p>“We’ve got cameras, panic buttons, security – everything a girl needs to stay safe,” says Kath.</p><p>“People think we get girls and lock them in their rooms and do horrible things to them.</p><p>“But we look after these girls and keep them safe. On the streets the girls have got nothing to protect them. They don’t know if they’re going to be the next victim.”</p><p>Jenni adds: “It’s ludicrous how they can shut down the massage parlours and then decriminalise the street.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/NINTCHDBPICT000542765935-1.jpg><h2>Custard ‘splashing’ and cake smashed in faces</h2><p>As well as fuelling a rise in street prostitution, austerity has seen a hike in the number of women working from home in the sex trade.</p><p>Lilly, who works two days in the City massage parlour, also sees clients in her own home, including builders, electricians and older clients who come to her out of loneliness.</p><p>“I see one guy and if he didn’t see me, the only person he’d see is the home help,” she says.</p><p>“Another client just wants to lie there and hold hands and touch, for the skin to skin contact, which people miss. It’s not all about sex.”</p><p>The former casino worker, who turned to sex work two years ago and says it pays more than her previous jobs, admits she hates having to constantly change and wash sheets.</p><p>“I have a paddling pool under the bed for splashing and food bookings, where people like to pour custard or smash chocolate gateaux in my face,” she says.</p><p>“Maple syrup is my favourite thing. I haven’t got bored of eating it off people yet.</p><p>“There’s quite a lot of food I can’t eat now because I’ve played with it, like yogurt. I can’t even smell it.”</p><p>Despite her booming home business she enjoys “hanging out with the girls” at the massage parlour and says: “The brothel is homely. Kath’s lovely, she’d do anything for anyone.”</p><p>For Kath’s part, constant reinvention is the way to keep punters coming through the door, and she is seen organising a ‘French maid soiree’ – dressing all her girls in sexy maid costumes - and introducing a £3000 sex doll for clients to use.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/NINTCHDBPICT000292053567.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/NINTCHDBPICT000292053625.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/NINTCHDBPICT000542765936-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/NINTCHDBPICT000542766398-1.jpg><h2>Homeless single mum taught tot to swim in brothel Jacuzzi</h2><p>Brothel owner Kath was born in red light district and, having grown up without a mum, she left home at 13 and ended up in care.</p><p>By 17, she was homeless and pregnant and she moved in with a friend who had a small flat.</p><p>“Unfortunately she took an overdose and she died and that was the point I thought, ‘I need to do something with my life,’” she says.</p><p>At 18, she got a job as receptionist at the original City Sauna, close to the current building, and says her daughter grew up hanging around the massage parlour – and even learned to swim in the Jacuzzi.</p><p>“In those days, pimps used to come, in fur coats, gold chains and pick the girls up,” she says.</p><p>“It used to be old men that ran the parlours. It was never heard of that a female ran one.”</p><p>Her own workers are carefully vetted to check they are not trafficked, on drugs or being coerced into selling sex in any way and she says she would report anyone she believed was being coerced.</p><p>She provides a monthly health check and regular beauty treatments and, despite the illegal nature of the business, police come and talk to the girls monthly to check they are safe.</p><p>However, with councils like Leeds cracking down, she admits she could be forced to close at any time.</p><p>But she insists safety in numbers should mean businesses like hers are decriminalised.<br>“You’re never going to stop girls from working,” she says. “So why not give them a safe place to work.”</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Lilly hopes to use the money from working at the brothel for her future career</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZn11fZhpcHJnppq%2FunnYqKmkq5iev6Z5waumraCVoXquwcxmm5qtl53Bpr6MrJyxZaekv6yx0axm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
