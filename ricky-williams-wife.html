"We argue. But we respect each other. And now we’re at a stage where we’ve really stabilized through it and developed through it.

"He doesn't have an attachment to material things but he also doesn't have an attachment to people, you know. I mean, whether it's me or his mom, his sisters, the kids... a lot of times our kids don't even notice that he's gone, which is not necessarily good or bad, but that's really how he is."&nbsp;</p><p>Kristin was also with Ricky when he was defrauded of millions of dollars by his financial advisor, Peggy Ann Fulford. When asked by the judge how much of Ricky's money Fulford stole, Kristin responded, "All of it." Fulford was sentenced to ten years in prison in 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>Luckily, Ricky was able to&nbsp;bounce right back.&nbsp;</p><p>"It wasn’t pleasant to find out that, you know, I thought I had $6 million in the bank only to find out I didn’t,’" Ricky explained. "A lot of people in that situation are stuck there. But I had enough skills and connections and intuition and drive to go out and do something about it. So it turned into a heroic story."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaJ2eqbKzwMCipaadnql8c3yQcmZpaV9ngnCVxpOAka18gYNwvsicorJlp565rbXApqpmr5mbsg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
