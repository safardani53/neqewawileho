only two dates that feature zinc-coated steel.&nbsp;</p><p>The other one is the&nbsp;<a href=#>1943 Lincoln steel penny</a>&nbsp;– which is much more common.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON COINS">READ MORE ON COINS</h2><p>The steel cent was made in an effort to conserve bronze for World War II.</p><p>But unlike the 1943 date, there is a scarce amount of 1944 steel pennies.&nbsp;</p><p>The following Lincoln steel cents were minted in 1944:</p><ul><li>1944 (no mintmark)</li><li>1944-D</li><li>1944-S</li></ul><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>A coin with a D mint mark means it was minted in Denver, while an S letter means it was struck in San Francisco.&nbsp;</p><p>No mintmarks typically mean that the piece was minted in Philadelphia.&nbsp;</p><p>All steel cents with the 1944 date have reported mintages of under 40.&nbsp;</p><p>While they are all quite rare, the 1944-S is the most valuable of the three – with a reported mintage of just two.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, many coin experts believe there are a few that have yet to be discovered.&nbsp;</p><p>“The 1944-S Steel Cent is an extremely rare off-metal striking created when a steel blank left over from 1943 was struck in the normal production run of 1944-S Bronze Cents," Ron Guth, President of Professional Coin Grading Services&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>.</p><p>Make sure not to confuse these with a 1943 date, as more than a billion steel pennies were produced that year.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-it-worth><strong>HOW MUCH IT COULD BE WORTH</strong></h2><p>You might have hit the jackpot if you happen to find a steel penny with a 1944 date.</p><p>As always, the value of coins could depend on grade and condition.&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to the 1944-S steel cent, it is worth $399,637 in average condition and could be worth more than $1.11million in an MS63 grade, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">USA Coin Book</a>.</p><p>In 2021, one in an MS66 grade sold for a record $408,000 at a Heritage Auction.</p><p>The grading scale only goes up to 70, meaning a 66 is very high.</p><p>The 1944 D steel cent is worth nearly $34,000 in average condition.&nbsp;</p><p>In an August 2007 auction, a 1944 D Lincoln steel cent graded in MS63&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">sold for $115,000</a>, according to PCGS.&nbsp;</p><p>As for the 1944 steel cent without a mintmark, it is worth more than $28,000 in average condition.&nbsp;</p><p>One 1944 steel cent graded in MS64 without a mark&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">sold</a>&nbsp;for $180,000 in an auction in June 2021.&nbsp;</p><h2
