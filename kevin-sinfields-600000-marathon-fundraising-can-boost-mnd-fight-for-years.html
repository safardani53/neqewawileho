Care centres ensure people with MND have access locally to the multidisciplinary care they need.</p><p>While Sinfield braves wind, rain and snow to pound the streets, work continues in international clinical drug trials to try and develop effective new treatments for MND.</p><p>Those cost a minimum of £5 million, often significantly more, but the MNDA looks to invest at least £500,000 to ensure people living with MND in this country are part of them.</p><p>And as an MNDA spokesman said: “Funds raised by Kevin would therefore ensure we can continue investing significant new funds into these world leading trials next year and beyond.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EoeuqxCWMAA87LC.jpg><p>Sinfield, joined yesterday by fellow legend Jamie Peacock and current Rhinos skipper Luke Gale, admitted he will try and remember the good times playing alongside Burrow to get him through the dark times on the road.</p><p>He said: “I’ll be celebrating the good times and memories I’ve had with Rob.</p><p>“When it gets a bit dark and I start to question, ‘What on earth am I doing?’ I’ll try and remember some of the good times and funny moments that Rob brought us.”</p><p>When Sinfield started his challenge on Tuesday, the fundraising total stood at £48,000 – by the time he finished his first marathon that had grown to an astonishing £90,000.</p><p>TV funnyman and St Helens fan Johnny Vegas donated while many offered items, including a signed shirt from England’s 2017 World Cup final, for auction.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AW3_3476.jpg><p>And Burrow’s message before he set off proved another inspiration as he said: “You must be mad.</p><p>“Kev, from day one, has always been a role model to me and someone who I’ve held in the highest regard.</p><p>“As I’ve said many times, I hope you know I’d do the same for you. It means everything to me. A friend in need is a friend indeed.”</p><p>Linda Allen, director of fundraising at the Motor Neurone Disease Association, said: “Kevin Sinfield’s epic challenge is such a moving tribute to his friendship with Rob Burrow, and to see how the rugby league community has reacted is heart-warming.</p><p>“Once again, people across the country have been inspired to dip their hands in their pockets and give generously. Watching the total increase almost hour by hour during Kevin’s challenge has been incredible.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3822-Kevin-Sinfield-7-in-7-Sinfield-at-very-start-CREDIT-PHIL-DALY-1-1.jpg><p>“And it hasn’t stopped there. Alongside the many individuals and groups who have been inspired to fundraise by Rob himself over the last year, there are now others who have been inspired by Kevin to get involved, creating this incredible community of support for people with MND.</p><p>“It is only thanks to this kind of generosity that the MND Association can continue to invest in world-leading research which, we all hope, will lead to significant breakthroughs uncovering the causes and potential treatments for MND, giving hope to Rob and the 5,000 people in the UK currently living with this brutal disease.</p><p>“In the meantime, of course, our thanks and good wishes for his remaining runs go to Kevin and all involved in his challenge.”</p><p><strong>*KEVIN Sinfield’s ‘7 in 7’ takes place until tomorrow.
