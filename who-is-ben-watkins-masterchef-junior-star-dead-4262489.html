It’s been devastating.” He noted that Ben spent the summer in the intensive care until, where “a golf ball-sized growth in Ben’s neck had spread into a grapefruit-sized tumor.” Eventually the tumors destroyed Ben’s lung in September and soon his right lung began collapsing. “We cannot thank this community enough for holding our family up in prayer and for all that you’ve done,” Ben’s family said in a public statement. “Ben was and will always be the strongest person we know.” We’ve for five things to know about Ben.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>1. Ben’s form of cancer was extremely rare. His uncle Anthony said that Ben was one of six people in the world to receive the rare diagnosis. The teen from Gary, Indiana began undergoing treatment <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>including chemotherapy</a> at Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ben-Watkins-masterchef-junion-dead-fox-post-.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>2. Ben lost both of his parents to a domestic violence incident.</strong>&nbsp;His mother and father <strong>Leila Edwards</strong>, 43, and <strong>Mike Watkins</strong>, 46, died in a Sept. 2017 murder-suicide. He was then left an orphan and raised by his uncle Anthony and grandmother <strong>Donna Edwards</strong>. They told the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Chicago Tribune</a> that they saw no warning signs and had no idea what caused Watkins to commit such a horrific act.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>3. Ben helped out at his parents’ restaurant, where he developed his love of cooking</strong>.&nbsp;Before his parents’ sad deaths, Ben worked at their Gary, Indiana restaurant Big Ben’s Bodacious Barbecue, Bakery & Deli. The couple even named the restaurant after their son. Sadly it closed within a month of his parents’ passing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ben-Watkins-masterchef-junion-dead-fox-post-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>4. Ben made the top 20 during his season of MasterChef Junior. </strong>Of the 40 season six contestants who ranged in age from eight to 14, Ben took 18th place. While he missed out on the $100,000 grand prize, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>he won the hearts of fans</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10><strong>5. Ben’s community rallied around him with a GoFundMe account following the death of his parents</strong>. It read: “The #Love4Ben campaign was originally intended to support Ben and his family after the passing of his parents in 2017. Due to the generosity of so many, we were able to establish a trust fund of nearly $30,000 at Peoples Bank in Munster, Indiana.” The family noted that Ben’s dream was to become an engineer, or possibly pursue an education in the culinary arts, and the money would go towards his schooling. After his cancer diagnosis, the funds grew larger as the money then went to help pay for his medical costs. It was at $190K at the time of Ben’s passing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2KvprqMsJito5mjwG65wKyrnqqTnbKnecmupaKnomLAta3RZpuemZRigXOCkW1vcmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
