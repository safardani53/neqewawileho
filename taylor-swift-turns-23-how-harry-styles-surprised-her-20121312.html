Turning another year older on Thursday Dec. 13, the Red singer is currently in England — homeland of her latest boyfriend, One Direction singer Harry Styles.
And the mop-topped lad definitely had something sweet cooked up for his love, to whom he was first linked romantically about a month ago.
“Harry Styles bought 23 custom cupcakes for Taylor Swift from Custom Cupcake Company in Chapelford, Warrington this morning,” a rep for the store tells Us Weekly exclusively."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He was really sweet, polite and a lovely guy. To be honest I was a little giddy and star struck. He was a perfect gentleman.”</p><p>The day before, the high-profile pair were spotted in rural England getting up close and personal with some feathered friends.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Swift had another big birthday surprise: her first-ever Golden Globe nomination. On Thursday morning, it was revealed that she’d been nominated for Best Original Song for “Safe and Sound,” the track for The Hunger Games.</p><p>“What an amazing and unexpected present!” she exclaimed in a statement. “I’m blown away by my first-ever Golden Globe nomination … Writing music for The Hunger Games was a labor of love – I was a fan of the stories and the characters, and we all wanted the music to have an authenticity that matched the tone of the movie and the emotions expressed in the book. This is a huge honor, and I’m really excited and so flattered. THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart to the Hollywood Foreign Press Association!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatmamhvLN50rCgn6xdqcKzutJmaWxlmKTEbrTAq6myZaOpxq2x0maqrqqgp7a0scNmn56qXWd9cn6QbGhrZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
