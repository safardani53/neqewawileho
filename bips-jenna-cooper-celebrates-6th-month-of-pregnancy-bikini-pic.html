I can’t believe I’m already in month 6 ahh! I feel like I still have so much to prepare, and it is very interesting watching my whole body growing rapidly😅But I’m just so thankful that baby is doing great, and apparently about the size of a pomegranate:P I got to hear the heartbeat going strong too❤️ I’m doing the best I can to stay super relaxed and happy, and I think it’s working😊Between sharing my news with all of you, and those amazing trips to Turks & Caicos..my anxiety is at an all-time low:) Pearl has been so sweet, and I think you’re right that she can sense the baby. And don’t worry, I’m not picking Pearl up since she’s getting a little hefty ha. Karl is always helping me with her, and it’s so sweet😭🐷It seems like my energy has been low and at any point I can just close my eyes and fall asleep, but besides that, everything is good! I luckily never had any morning sickness, and not really any crazy cravings either. I’ve been meaning to ask what some of your cravings were?! And if you have any suggestions for light exercise that might help boost my energy?😅More updates coming soon!</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=#>𝑱𝒆𝒏𝒏𝒂 𝑪𝒐𝒐𝒑𝒆𝒓</a> (@jennacooperfit) on Feb 4, 2020 at 5:57am PST</p><p>The Indiana native <a href=#>announced last month that she is pregnant</a> with her and her boyfriend <strong>Karl Hudson</strong>’s first child. “I hope you know that I already love you more than I could have imagined possible,” Cooper captioned a January mirror selfie. “I hope you chase all of your dreams, and I’ll be there supporting you the whole way. I hope you get my spirit and sense of humor, and never stop laughing. I hope you get your daddy’s thoughtfulness and work ethic, and never stop being curious. I hope you can ignore the negativity of the world, and always stand up for yourself. I hope you love Jesus with all your heart, and never forget how special you are. See you in a few months.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jenna-Cooper-Celebrates-6th-Month-of-Pregnancy-With-Bikini-Baby-Bump-Pic-1.jpg><p>The former ABC personality competed for <a href=#><strong>Arie Luyendyk Jr.</strong></a>‘s heart on season 22 of<a href=#> The Bachelor </a>before looking for love on Bachelor in Paradise season 5.
