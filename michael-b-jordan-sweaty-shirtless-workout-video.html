The video included clips of him getting flirty with on-screen love interest <strong>Chanté Adams&nbsp;</strong>and him going shirtless while in a bedroom. The results of his disciplined fitness routine are clearly shown in the new flick and his acting abilities are greater than ever.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>In addition to social media posts and movies, Michael sometimes shows off his fit body and charming good looks in ads. He wowed in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a Coach ad</a> alongside <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong></a> just three weeks ago. In one of the campaign pics, he was standing outside while smiling and surrounded by others engaged in all sorts of activities. He wore various Coach clothing items, including a brown leather oversized aviator jacket with shearling lining, brown knit pants, black leather combat boots, and held the navy leather Hitch Backpack With Varsity Stripe.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>After appearing in the campaign, Michael released a statement about how much he appreciated the concept of the pics. “The idea of being amongst friends means being around people you’re comfortable with,” he said. “People you can be yourself with, grow with, be creative with. It’s about being in an environment that makes you comfortable, where you can be authentic and thrive.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH15e5BxZqahk52upriMm2Sjp6KZrq950rCcmqypYsCptdGto56ro2LEsL7KqKytZaaesaa7jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
