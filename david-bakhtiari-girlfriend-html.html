“Bloopers” is a fitting word to describe the photos as the proposal had it all that it needs in a movie — romance, a picturesque background, a well-known leading man, suspenseful music, and a happy ending."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Only when Bakhtiari got&nbsp;down on one knee, the tears started flowing. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She immediately broke&nbsp;down crying with amazement repeatedly saying, “I’m in shock.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Bakhtiari then pointed&nbsp;out the well-wishers waiting for them on the shore to which Shebby responded by joyously waving to them.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>She posted photographs of the ring and the pair celebrating their engagement on land the next day on Instagram. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Who Is David Bakhtiari’s Girlfriend?</h2><p>Shebby is a foodie and an entrepreneur.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Bakhtiari, 30, and Shebby, 26, were dating for almost three years since October 2017 before they decided to get engaged.</p><p>They both <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">played</a><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> volleyball</a> at the University of Colorado and the University of Oregon.

After a previous wreat&nbsp;she had fashioned&nbsp;died, she took an interest in wreath-making.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>This was when she first moved in with her then-boyfriend and now fiance.
