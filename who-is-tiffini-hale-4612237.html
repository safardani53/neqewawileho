Her co-stars included Deedee, Chase, Jeune, and Damon. She remained on the Disney Channel show until 1991. Following Tiffini’s departure,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Britney Spears</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Justin Timberlake</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ryan Gosling</strong></a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Christina Aguilera</strong></a> all joined the show.</p><h2><strong><span><i>She was in a Disney pop band</i><i>.</i></span></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>In 1990, Tiffini, as well as Deedee, Chase, Jeune, and Damon, were chosen by Disney executives to lead a Disney pop band called The Party. They were signed to Hollywood Records label. The group released two studio albums, 1990’s&nbsp;The Party&nbsp;and 1992’s&nbsp;Free, as well as an EP/Remix album, an outtakes album, and a compilation album. Some of their singles included “Summer Vacation,” “In My Dreams,” “Sugar Is Sweet,” and “All About Love.” The Party disbanded in 1993, but got back together in 2013. Tiffini, however, did not take part in the reunion.</p><h2><strong><span><i>She was close with her former co-stars/bandmates</i><i>.</i></span></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Tiffini seemed to have a close bond with Deedee, Chase, Jeune, and Damon. She spent so much time with them on&nbsp;The All-New Mickey Mouse Club, and then as members of The Party. In their Facebook tribute to Tiffini after her death, the foursome said that Tiffini’s “beauty, talent, style and fun loving spirit” would “forever live in our hearts and memories.” They signed the tribute from them four, as well as “the entire Mickey Mouse Club Family.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/tiffini-hale-5-things-to-know-ec-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Tiffini appeared to be especially close with Chasen, who posted <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>his own tribute</a> on Instagram to the late actress/singer. “Part of her magic was that she never knew how incredible she truly was,” Chasen said. “She was humble, she was thoughtful and kind. She was playful and so funny. An incredible singer, character & dramatic actress , and when the music hit her dancing skills to me we’re unmatched by any female pop star since! She was an absolutely amazing performer & I’m so so honored to of had her in my life.” He went on to write that he’s “so incredible torn” that he “will&nbsp;never be able to hug her tight again.” He added about Tiffini, “I Miss You Terribly!&nbsp;Forever my sweet sister.”</p><h2><strong><span><i>She appeared on a hit ’90s show</i><i>.</i></span></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>In 1993, Tiffini appeared as herself on one episode of the hit NBC sitcom&nbsp;Blossom, which starred <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Mayim Bialik</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Joey Lawrence</strong></a>.
