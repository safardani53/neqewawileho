Though Kinsey’s admiration for cats is downright normal in comparison, she revealed to Us the most indulgent thing she does for her pets.</p><p>“I tend to buy them things that I don’t know that they always need,” she explained to Us. “I have a Christmas stocking for them. They get presents, and … I’m like, ‘Here’s your present, try to open it, you’re going to love it.’ So I think I do stuff like that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Angela-Kinsey-Im-a-Cat-Lady-Just-Like-my-Office-Character-02.jpg><p>The Haters Back Off! actress also noted that she will “talk to them like I’m having a conversation.”</p><p>In honor of National Bring Your Cat to the Vet day on August 22, Kinsey stressed to Us the importance of getting a cat properly checked out. “It’s harder to get our cats to the vet. It’s easier to get dogs to the vet,” she said. “I think because cats are loners, it’s hard to know how they’re doing, how’s their health.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>To hear Kinsey gush over her fur family, watch the exclusive video above!
