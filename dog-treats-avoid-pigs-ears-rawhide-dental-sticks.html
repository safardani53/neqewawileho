Pigs ears</h2><p>He said: “Number one, pig ears,” and then referenced swine, which is a “contagious viral disease of animals that primarily affects” pigs.&nbsp;</p><p>The expert claimed “swine is hands down the dirtiest animal” and said the conditions pigs are kept in are dirty.&nbsp;</p><p>“Stop feeding your dog pig ears, it’s hands down the worst part of the pig as well,” he remarked.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a href=# aria-label="Natural Farm Pet (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Natural Farm Pet</a>, “some vets may recommend pig ears as a treat for dogs in moderation, while others may advise against it due to the potential risks associated with them, such as bacterial contamination, choking, and digestive issues”.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE PET CONTENT ">READ MORE PET CONTENT</h2><p>“It's best to consult with your veterinarian to determine if pig ears are a suitable treat for your dog.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. Dental sticks</h2><p>The dog expert added: “Second, dental sticks. Don’t care which ones you get - natural, unnatural, they’re all bunch of s***.</p><p>“If you actually want to clean your dog's <a href=#>teeth</a>, brush your dog's <span id=7a106c12-3bef-4b18-8247-bf3013504d44 class=suggested-link>teeth</span>."</p><p>Brushing your <a href=#>dogs</a> teeth daily is just as important as brushing your own, but currently, less than one percent of pet parents brush their cats or <span id=58ae88ec-88ed-44c8-9294-943ba450bcd7 class=suggested-link>dogs</span> teeth, according to Scrumbles.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>There is no substitute for an old-fashioned toothbrush and paste (dog-specific toothpaste not human), but for convenience, a lot of people use oral care dog chews and dog dental sticks like Dentastix, which claim to keep your dog’s teeth clean and healthy.&nbsp;</p><p>But the list of ingredients that make up dental chews isn’t detailed - and they often include fatty ingredients, additives, and cereals, of which the latter turn to sugar when ingested, which can actually lead to cavities and bad breath, according to <a href=# aria-label="Scrumbles (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Scrumbles</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>To add to this, the soft chew doesn’t do much to naturally rub away at plaque, especially if your dog eats quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. Rawhide</h2><p>“Thirdly, we will never feed our dogs rawhide," @cherryhoggs said.</p><p>"Rawhide is by far one of the worst parts of the animal, it’s highly processed it’s very hard for the digestive tract to digest, it has no nutritional value.&nbsp;</p><p>“There’s so many better alternatives like liver or dehydrated beef or normal meat sources.</p><p>“So don't take these treats, and opt for better alternatives,” he concluded.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a href=# aria-label="Purina (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Purina</a>, a leading pet brand, rawhide is a “dog chew that’s a by-product of the leather industry”.&nbsp;</p><p>They explained: “It’s made from the inner layer of either cow or horse hides (which is their skin). The outer layer of the hides is the leather part that’s used for shoes, garments, upholstery, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>“The inner rawhide is treated, dehydrated and then formed into various shapes as a dog chew.&nbsp;</p><p>“The most common type of rawhide for dogs is a rawhide bone which is made up of layers of rawhide manipulated into a bone shape.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>As for whether it is safe for a dog to eat, Purina said: “It can be very dangerous for puppies, as it can cause intestinal blockages and can also be a choking hazard.&nbsp;</p><p>“Because of this, it’s best to avoid giving your pup rawhide and seek safer alternatives for your pet to gnaw on!”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5FuaWlpYGt%2FcLDOoGStqpWWwbR5wK%2Bmopxdpbaov4yemKurXaeuuLTInZxmnJWjwaK4jKyropubqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
