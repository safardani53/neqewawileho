But Peters sympathizes with fans who are left wanting more each week. The cast members, who are currently still shooting season one, are just as eager for answers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It’s the same for us – we’re like, ‘Give me the next script! Let’s go, let’s read!'” he says with a laugh. “We’re a couple episodes ahead of viewers. I know what they’re going through, it sucks. But I’m on lockdown. They’ll find out.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The one thing he will reveal about what’s to come the scary FX show? “It only gets worse.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Luckily, Peters was willing to give PEOPLE.com an inside look at the cast, the house, and why Jessica Lange doesn’t bring her dog to set.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>We can’t imagine what a show like this one would look like on paper what did you think when you first read the script?</b><br>It looked cool! It looked interesting and scary and it looked like a horror film, basically. I was intrigued by it and I was thinking, how they going to keep this going? It’s with new twists and turns and closing storylines and opening new ones. It psychologically screws you. And it’s a good kind of scary. It sticks with you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>What’s the house like in person?</b><br>It’s terrifying. It’s a real house in L.A. that’s old and creepy and there’s actually a chapel connected to it. The whole atmosphere there is really terrifying. They built the inside of the house on the [sound] stages so you go there and it looks pretty identical.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>How much do you shoot in the actual house?</b><br>We were there for the whole pilot, now just exterior shots. We heard some noises and stuff shooting but that’s to be expected in a three-story house with an attic. It’s just a creepy house, it’s so terrifying, with that wood everywhere. I would never, ever want to live in that house.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>What’s the mood like on set? Some of the characters are very intense does anyone stay in character the whole time?</b><br>Like Daniel Day-Lewis or something? No, the mood is cool and normal. I’d love to be crazy the whole time but I don’t think it’s possible to be Tate the whole time and be professional. Jessica Lange is a sweetheart, the nicest lady in the world. She has a Poodle named Jack.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>If I had a dog I wouldn t bring him to this particular set</b><br>Yeah, they might get thrown <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>in a microwave</a> or something.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>Your storyline has been more intense by the episode, especially with last week’s school shooting. What was that like to film?</b><br>It s a really sick, sad thing that happened. The problem is that it’s not made up – I think that’s why it’s so disturbing. And there have been so many school shootings, not just Columbine. Such a terrible thing. That aside, it’s very cool to go around and be totally insane, that’s an actors dream. It was hard to do and a pretty intense experience but also fun and interesting to do.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>Were you a horror movie fan before you got this role?</b><br>I wasn’t a huge horror movie fan before because they kinda stress me out. Since working on the show I’ve definitely gotten into it a lot more and I have an appreciation for what’s going on behind the scenes. I used to look at horror movies as being really real and it would totally freak me out and give me nightmares. Now I watch and think, whoa how’d they do that?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>How has your family reacted to your character?</b><br>My mom can’t watch it. My dad told her, “Don’t ever watch [the school shooting] episode.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>What’s it been like for the cast to watch the show take off like this?</b><br>I don’t think it’s really hit. It hasn’t hit me. I’m focused on getting this season done. I don’t really know what’s going on in the outside world!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>So you don’t have fans coming up to you on the street?</b><br>At the Blockbuster I go to, the guy was like, ‘Dude, you’re on American Horror Story. I love that show!’ ”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6SrfKK5xKugnJmeYrWwvtGoqWarpKS%2Fur%2BMnq2apl2lsrWx0axkoqxdn8K0wIygnK2rXay8s7%2FEaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
