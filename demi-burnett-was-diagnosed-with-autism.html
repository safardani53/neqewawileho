She also included a “trigger warning” in the post, just in case. Burnett desired a higher quality of life and told her followers that she would reveal more of her tale and how she “came to all this point” in the future. The graphics in the thread detailed the autism spectrum, how to help a neurodivergent individual, what ableism is, a chart of autistic tendencies versus trauma symptoms, and much more.</p><p>Many members of the Bachelor Nation, including Onyeka Ehie, Kirpa Sudick, and Maurissa Gunn, expressed their support for Burnett after her diagnosis.&nbsp;Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental impairment that may create social, communication, and behavioral issues in which the individual may interact, behave, or learn differently than others, according to the CDC.</p><h2>Demi Burnett is a reality television personality.</h2><p>The reality personality, born on February 21, 1982, in Red Oak, Texas, is 26 years old. She featured on Season 6 of Bachelor In Paradise after being removed from Colton Underwood’s season of The Bachelor, where she got engaged to Kristian Haggerty. The pair made history when they became the first same-s*x couple to engage in the program. In October 2019, they called off their engagement. She subsequently began dating prominent musician Slater Davis, whom she dated for a few months before splitting up. She revealed in an interview with Entertainment Tonight in June 2020, saying:</p><p>“I’m really smitten with him. He’s the finest of all time. I feel like a strange little sucker, but he’s the most wonderful guy I’ve ever met, and I can’t get enough of him.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Demi-Burnett-2.jpg alt="Demi Burnett" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Burnett has previously been on Season 7 of Bachelor In Paradise. In 2021, she was a player on ABC’s Celebrity Dating Game, where she had prospective love interests from both men and women. Burnett took her mental health struggle public in January 2022 when she announced in a now-deleted Instagram post that she was experiencing emotional breakdowns every few hours. She stated:</p><p>“This is going to be the most difficult thing I’ve ever posted, and I’m so humiliated, but I’m going to be honest.” My ego is enraged. Happy New Year, this is me 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I’m not doing anything to make anybody jealous; I’m not ‘happy,’ and I’m not sociable. I’m always thinking, sobbing, and trying to figure out what’s going on.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Demi-Burnett-3.jpg alt="Demi Burnett" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In another post, Burnett said that she was obtaining professional therapy and doing well. She promotes a variety of fashion, beauty, and travel businesses on Instagram, where she has over a million followers. Demi is a proud country girl who grew up in rural Texas. ABC says she enjoys riding ATVs, fishing, and watching WWE.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGibnqWZYq%2B2vs2eq61lp5bAbrDImp6np6OasW7DyK2fZpmlqba0uY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
