Anybody arguing against Taylor being named the greatest darts player of all time probably needs their head examined.
In his pomp, The Power was unbeatable and had no equal, dominating the sport throughout the 1990s and 2000s."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Candidates have been judged on their displays at world level, longevity and impact on the sport.</p><h2><strong>1: Phil Taylor</strong></h2><p>SIXTEEN world titles – two in the BDO, 14 at PDC level – between 1990 and 2013 is why Taylor is the Greatest.</p><p>Taylor, who turns 60 in August, was untouchable at his best, relentless in his pursuit of titles, tournament cheques and nine-darters.</p><p>The Stoke star lifted the Lakeside crown on his debut and nobody will ever eclipse his records.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NINTCHDBPICT000139403688.jpg><h2><strong>2: Eric Bristow</strong></h2><p>THE Crafty Cockney was the master of the mind games and was a huge figure during the smoky, boozy days of the 1980s.</p><p>Bristow won five world titles when the BDO was at its competitive best, including three-in-a-row, beating top rivals John Lowe and Jocky Wilson.</p><p>There could have been even more – he also lost in five world finals before his powers waned and the sport turned professional.</p><p>Bristow <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">died of a heart attack aged 60</a> in April 2018.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/79c2fe69-53da-4555-bfcd-4faef9dfbef4.jpg><h2><strong>3: Michael van Gerwen</strong></h2><p>THE current world No.1 and three-time world champion has already shown by the age of 31 that he deserves his place among the legends.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Dutchman</a> has won every major title – including five Premier Leagues at the O2 Arena – and led the way over the past four years.</p><p>He has time on his side to leave a lasting legacy in the sport and overtake Bristow in the rankings. Taylor, by his own admission, is too far away to match.</p><p>The big question is whether having two young children, not to mention the £8million in prize money, will dilute his motivation for more trophies.</p><p>His form has dipped since lockdown plus he is suffering from a back injury – time for him to remind us why he deserves such praise.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/c7e5dbdc-3c02-474e-812c-e07af3782718.jpg><h2><strong>4: Raymond van Barneveld</strong></h2><p>THE tall Dutchman will be forever remembered for that stunning last-leg shootout win over Phil Taylor at the Circus Tavern in 2007.</p><p>Only one man has won more than his five world titles but four of them were in the BDO and he never quite challenged consistently when he moved to the PDC circuit.</p><p>Barney, 53, retired last year and remains one of the most recognisable names in the sport.</p><p>Yet, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">as revealed first by SunSport in September</a>, Barney is aiming for a comeback at Q School in January.

Two years later, he said he was given 'the all-clear' by doctors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NINTCHDBPICT000377577234.jpg><h2><strong>8: John Part</strong></h2><p>THE PDC foolishly forgot to put up an image of Part on their Ally Pally drapes a few years ago – and were rightly criticised for it.</p><p>It would be easy to overlook his achievements. But in a sport dominated by Brits and Dutchmen, Canadian Part broke the mould and gave non-Europeans hope.</p><p>Darth Maple, 54, has three world titles – one on the BDO and two in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">PDC</a> – and even beat Taylor in his pomp in a Circus Tavern final.</p><p>Reluctant to up sticks from his Ontario home town, Part spent many years on the road and is now an accomplished broadcaster.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NINTCHDBPICT000290459127.jpg><h2><strong>9: Glen Durrant</strong></h2><p>ONE of only three men to win three successive world darts titles.</p><p>The Middlesbrough thrower, who turns 50 this month, was a senior housing advisor in the north east while playing at Lakeside but gave that up in 2019 to focus full-time on the PDC circuit.</p><p>An argument could be made that the standard or strength-in-depth wasn’t as strong in the BDO when he was lifting world crowns and claiming more than £350,000 in prize money – but that should take nothing away from his achievements.</p><p>Winning the PDC Premier League in October <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">is a breakthrough moment on the pro ranks</a> and likely to be the first of many trophies on that side of the divide.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ad51ea07-9f28-465d-90a1-f14c12036b64.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Sport</h2></p><h2><strong>10: Dennis Priestley</strong></h2><p>A CASE could have been made for two-time world champion Adrian Lewis but Jackpot’s alarming drop in form in recent years counts against him.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>In comparison, Priestly embodied longevity and toughness and deserves his place in the pantheon.</p><p>The 70-year-old has two world trophies on his mantelpiece and would have more – had he not been stopped FOUR times in the final by a rampant Taylor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NINTCHDBPICT000001478394.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Sky Sports darts presenter Dave Clark speaks about living with Parkinson’s disease</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH50fZhqbG5xX6m8sXnTnqVmnJGnwbR5z6WYsp2iqHqiuMtmq6KllWLBosXLqKlmrpGjeqix0bCcp2c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
