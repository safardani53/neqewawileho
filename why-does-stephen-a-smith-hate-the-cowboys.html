Stephen A. Smith has long been one of the most colorful and entertaining men in sports television, and he has also fostered a reputation for really loathing one franchise in particular.</p><p>Over the years, Stephen has said that he is "nauseated" by the fanbase of the Dallas Cowboys and that fans of that team "make him sick." Following those severe remarks, it was only natural for many people to wonder where Stephen's loathing of the Cowboys comes from.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why does Stephen A. Smith hate the Dallas Cowboys?</h2><p>In October of 2023, Stephen dove into the reasons for his hatred after going on yet another tirade against the team. Marcus Spears, one of his co-hosts, pressed the issue, asking him to explain why he hates the team so much.</p><p>"They just annoy me," Stephen said in response. "They just annoy me. I'm not gonna lie to you in my lifetime. I had a lady friend, and they were a Cowboys fan."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Stephen's declaration that he once had a partner who was a fan of the team did clarify his vitriol to some extent, but he didn't go into much more detail about that relationship.</p><p>Fans offered some additional detail, saying that Stephen had first told that story a decade ago, and that the woman apparently ghosted him. She was a Cowboys fan, so now he hates the Cowboys.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Stephen A. Smith roasted the Cowboys after a loss to the Bills.</h2><p>Following a 31-10 loss to the Bills on Dec. 17, Stephen took the opportunity to gloat, clearly glad that one of his least beloved franchises had been on the receiving end of the blowout.</p><p>“You sat up there listing to old Stevie Atell you Dak Prescott MVP candidate. ... I didn't tell you about the running game of Buffalo. I ain't tell you about the inclement weather. I ain't tell you about Western New York and how the Dallas Cowboys ain't fit to deal with such adverse conditions," he said.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>"I let it set up there and believe that those Dallas Cowboys gonna be special. ... And they got stomped. What did I tell you? I'm gonna leave you alone for now," he added.</p><p>The Cowboys are 10-4 following the loss and still playoff bound, and it seems like Stephen will be rooting against them the whole way.</p><p>There are plenty of neutral, impartial commentators out there, but Stephen has never been one of them, and that's why people love him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOonKxlo6mysbTEp2SaZaOitrW0jKGYrZ1dqbWmecKorpunqag%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
