The insider tells <i>Us </i>that Kim “rushed to be by Kanye’s side.”</p><p>According to NBC News, the Los Angeles police responded to a medical welfare call about 1:20 p.m. PT on Monday, and West was hospitalized for his own health and safety. (LAPD media relations confirmed to <i>Us</i> that police responded to a disturbance call that turned into a medical emergency around 1:20 p.m. PT.) According to TMZ, the rapper was taken to UCLA Medical Center and was evaluated for severe sleep deprivation.&nbsp;</p><p>A source close to the rapper told <i>Us</i> that West has “been suffering from exhaustion and sleep deprivation and went to the hospital today on his own will and under the consultation of his physician.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kris-jenner-f9ed4d33-f40c-489d-ad0e-6cf3d1062b5a.jpg><p>At the gala, Kris Jenner told <i>Entertainment Tonight </i>that West has been suffering from exhaustion when asked why he canceled his remaining Saint Pablo tour dates earlier on Monday. “He’s just really tired,” she said. “It’s a grueling tour.”</p><p>Kourtney also shared Instagram photos while at the bash Monday night. “Reunited with my angels,” she captioned a photo with Khloé, <b>Allie Rizzo</b> and <b>Nicole Reda</b>.</p><p>A source previously confirmed to<i> Us</i> that West canceled the dates due to exhaustion.</p><p>“He’s just exhausted,” a source told <i>Us</i>. “He’s been working around the clock on fashion design, both his own line and the Adidas line. He’s a notorious workaholic … so balancing both that work — which is extremely important to him — and the rigors of the tour every night, it really wore him out. All the time spent away from his family has been a stress on him, as well. They are the most important to him. Obviously he’s a professional and wants to give his fans a great experience, and I think his gut was telling him not to extend the tour through the end of the year, but he decided to push through. He doesn’t want to give his fans anything less than the best.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><span class=caption></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakoZ1iuKK%2Bw5qqoaGRo3q0t8ipqmaZnpyyrXnGmqOaZZGitqV5ypqlsp1drLK0wIyhpqyomamurbXZmquip55ixHWBkHJnamc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
