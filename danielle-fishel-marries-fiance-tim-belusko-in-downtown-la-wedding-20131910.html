The Boy Meets World actress, 32, tied the knot at the downtown L.A. wedding venue, Vibiana.</p><p>The couple celebrated in a candlelit ceremony that took place on a small staircase in a catheral. The blushing bride wore a strapless dress for her special day, with her hair down in waves. Her bouquet consisted of purple flowers, and bridesmaids wore midnight blue dresses, which tied in with the stunning overall color theme.</p><p>After the nuptials, guests — including Fishel's former Boy Meets World costar and TV hubby <strong>Ben Savage</strong> — were escorted to a courtyard for cocktails.</p><p>Fishel <a href=#>revealed she was engaged</a> to Belusko in a post on her Tumblr page in December 2012, while simultaneously announcing she was "officially a college graduate." Though she worried she'd be the "old lady in class," the actress went back to school at age 27. "I persevered and sometimes I wasn't the oldest person in class, some of the whisperers became good friends, and I did so well in math, I even became a tutor. And that is how I met my fiance," she shared.</p><p>At an event in West Hollywood on Oct. 8, Fishel dished with Us about her <a href=#>wedding plans</a>. "Midnight blue is my main color," she said. "I think it's perfect for a this-time-of-year wedding. Kind of big, like 250 people. It's going to be really fun! I'm really excited about it."</p><p>After the ceremony, Fishel plans to squeeze in a honeymoon trip to Maui before reprising her role as Topanga in the upcoming Disney Channel spin-off show Girl Meets World, which begins filming in November.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Though Fishel may now officially be married to Belusko, the actress told <strong>Us</strong> that costar<strong> </strong>Savage<strong> </strong>will always be her "first husband" and Belusko "totally accepts that."</p><p>"He knows that Ben and I have been together for a long time as an on-screen couple," she explained, "and to a certain extent when you've been with someone for 20 years like that, it's impossible to have none of that rub off a little bit in person."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadmZ6esq24xGadoquYmrluucCrqaKdo2Kzqq3NnJxmrJmieqOxy66qpKddnrtusM6wpa2np6N6ra2MsJydnJmjtG5%2Bj2pqanFhZXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
