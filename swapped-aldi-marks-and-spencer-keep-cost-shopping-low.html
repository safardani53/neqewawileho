My trolley consists of lots of fruit and veg now.</p><p>“Generally speaking, loose fruit and veg is cheaper because you’re obviously buying less. Because there’s only two of us, I don’t want to buy a whole bag of potatoes, I don’t need a whole bag of potatoes - they’ll go off before I use them.</p><p>“Same thing goes for meat, I’m not going to buy a huge pack of meat that will go off once it's opened within two days.</p><p>“I can just buy portions like this [chicken leg portions] that are used for one meal for two people, for £1.50.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>Not only does Gi only buy the portion sizes that she needs, but she also avoids pre-made foods too, as she added: “One of the main things I try to avoid is pre-made foods. Like these cheesy jacket potatoes. The thing is, they’re potatoes, with grated cheese on the top. It’s spending so much more than you need to for something you could make very easily.</p><p>“These huge pasta bakes and lasagnes are £7.75, which would feed a massive family. However, if you bought the ingredients and made it yourself, I can almost guarantee that it would definitely be cheaper.</p><p>“I understand that ready meals are sometimes the only option, but take this pizza - it’s £3.75 and if you break it down, really it’s just bread, cheese and tomato puree.”</p><p>Finally, Gi explained that cutting back on sweet treats has also reduced how much money she spends on food shopping, as she concluded: “A lot of people put a lot of snacks and treats in their trolley, which is absolutely ok, but we don’t.</p><p>“If I was buying those things, I probably wouldn’t be saying that M&S is cheaper than Aldi, because we know that M&S is famous for their treats - and they’re really expensive.</p><p>“Honestly, my biggest advice for saving money on shopping is to cut down on the ready-made meals, buy fresh and buy what you need.”&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=#>TikTok</a> clip, which was posted under the username @<a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">whatgabdid</a>, has started discussions online, as social media users explained which supermarkets they like to shop in, and the ways in which they <a href=#>save money</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>One person said: “Love M&S, I would never shop in <a href=#>Aldi</a> or <a href=#>Lidl</a> again.”</p><p>Another added: “Your page is brilliant, great video again.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Meanwhile, a third then advised: “You could buy a whole chicken, prep it yourself and save loads. We did a whole chicken for less than £7. We get 3 meals a week out of it.”</p><p><strong>Fabulous will pay for your exclusive stories.
