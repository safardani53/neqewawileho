The 35-year-old Gossip Girl alum attended Barnard College’s Annual Gala on Monday, April 24, in New York City. Lively was a vibrant sight, stepping out floral Carolina Herrera dress. The dainty frock featured an off-the-shoulder neckline and a billowing skirt. The A Simple Favor actress teamed the design with a bright orange and pink trench coat that was equipped with a neon yellow lining."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

During the soirée, Lively presented an award on stage. Before handing over the trophy, the Green Lantern actress joked about going back to college after landing “zero acting jobs.” Her luck changed just “two weeks” later, however, when producers of Gossip Girl called. “They said, ‘Listen, will you please do this show? And, if you do, we promise you can go to Columbia one day a week as long as it doesn’t interfere with our seven-day shooting schedule,’” Lively recalled as the audience erupted with laughter. “Needless to say, this is the closest I’m going to get to college, so I’m just going to pretend this is me graduating.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Blake-Lively-Makes-First-Red-Carpet-Appearance-Since-Welcoming-Baby-2.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>Lively and Reynolds, 46, welcomed their fourth child in February.
