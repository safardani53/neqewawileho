It does not mean that it comes with the territory. It's my body, and it should be my choice, and the fact that it is not my choice is absolutely disgusting. I can't believe that we even live in that kind of world.”</p><p>The man who the FBI have named responsible is Ryan Collins, a 36-year-old married father of two from Pennsylvania.</p><p>It is believed he worked for an e-commerce business and used to be a personal chef.</p><p><strong>Got a story?</strong> email <a href=#>digishowbiz@the-sun.co.uk</a> or call us direct on 02077824220</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhpZWd%2FcYGQaJqepJWXv6rA2GaZop9dl7%2BwwMeeqaxlkaqvs7HYZqadmamoeq%2Btyp6bZqSVlrimsIypoJyspaeybr%2FHqJqkZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
