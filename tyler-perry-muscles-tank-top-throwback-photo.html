He revealed he lost 30 pounds ahead of filming, telling <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Men’s Health </a>it was a life-changing experience. “I walk into a room with a lot more confidence. All my life I’ve tried to hide my height. I was taller than everybody else and stood out, so I would slouch and try to hide it,” Tyler explained. “But with what I’ve been able to do with my body, I’m owning it. I’m standing up when I walk into a room.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH5ze5FyZq2xnJq%2FbrzEq6myZZ2qwKS4xKxkrZmeoHq1u89mq6Gqn6yvoq%2FKZqehp6SkfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
