This included several complex foreign policy decisions that led to the deaths of millions of people. His work alongside Presidents Nixon and Ford placed him in the metaphorical Republican Hall of Fame.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But he did a lot of impressive things to get there. Essentially beginning as a refugee from <a href=#>Nazi Germany</a>, Henry assimilated into American culture through his Army service and education. He received his B.A. from Harvard in 1950 and later received his Masters and Ph.D. in Philosophy in 1951 and 1954, respectively.</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Henry Kissinger</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">American politician, diplomat, political scientist, and geopolitical consultant</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $50 Million</p><p>Henry Kissinger was an American security advisor and Secretary of State whose policies affected world politics for generations to come.</p><p><strong>Birth name: </strong>Heinz Alfred Kissinger</p><p><strong>Birthdate</strong>: May 27, 1923</p><p><strong>Birthplace</strong>: Fürth, Bavaria, Germany</p><p><strong>Mother: </strong>Paula Kissinger (née Stern)</p><p><strong>Father:</strong> Louis Kissinger</p><p><strong>Education: </strong>B.A. summa cum laude in political science from Harvard (1950), M.A. from Harvard (1951), Doctor of Philosophy from Harvard (1954)</p><p><strong>Spouse: </strong>Anneliese "Ann" Fleischer (m. 1949, d. 1964), Nancy Maginnes (m. 1974)</p><p><strong>Children: </strong>Elizabeth Kissinger (b. 1959), David Kissinger (b. 1961)</p><p><strong>Died: </strong>Nov. 29, 2023</p><p><strong>Place of Death: </strong>Kent, Conn., U.S.A.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While Henry initially despised Nixon, when he saw that Nixon was gaining traction in the election, he contacted Nixon’s team to offer support, hoping to impact foreign policy. They were described as “unusually close.” Henry’s position in Nixon’s Cabinet led to relations with China, Vietnam, the Koreas, and of course, Israel.</p><p>Henry also had a hand in the Bangladesh Liberation War, relations with the Soviet Union, the Persian Gulf, the Turkish Invasion of Cyprus, the 1973 Chilean coup d’état, the Argentinian “Dirty War,” Brazil’s nuclear weapons program, the Rhodesian Bush War, the Portuguese Empire, the Indonesian occupation of East Timor, relations with Cuba, the Western Sahara conflict, and relations with Zaire.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Despite all of Henry’s work in politics, he amassed most of his fortune from speaking engagements, book deals, consulting work, television appearances, and real estate. In 1979, a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times article</a> estimated he was receiving $400,000 to $600,000 per year for this work, which was equivalent to about $1.4 to $2.1 million today.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Henry was paid $15-20,000 for a single speaking engagement in the 1970s and 80s. He earned $5 million in advances and royalties for his book, The White House Years, and $1 million as a special consultant on world affairs for NBC.</p><p>As far as his real estate goes, his family now owns properties in New York, Connecticut, and Palm Springs, Calif. In Connecticut, they own a 300-acre estate, which angered locals because they cut down thousands of blueberry bushes to dissuade locals from trespassing. They also own an apartment in New York City’s River House, which likely costs at least $15 to 20 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnbKvvthmoqKro567qLHRZqWerF2svLPAxw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
