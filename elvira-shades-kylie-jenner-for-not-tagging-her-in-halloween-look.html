The Hulu personality recreated three different Elvira outfits, including one that involved nipple tassels and a giant spiderweb. “Kyvira,” the beauty mogul captioned an <a href=#>Instagram</a> photo of the risqué look.</p><p>After the Kylie Cosmetics founder shared photos of the costume, the real Elvira weighed in via <a href=#>Instagram</a>, sharing a meme that read: “In a world full of Kardashians be an Elvira.” The Kansas native shared the image on Tuesday, adding the hashtags, “#elvira #elviramistressofthedark.”</p><p>The horror icon — whose real name is Cassandra Peterson — <a href=#>created the Elvira character in the 1980s</a> after landing a handful of small roles in films and TV shows. From 1981 to 1986, she hosted Elvira’s Movie Macabre, a TV program that showcased low-budget horror films. The series was revived for one additional season in 2010. She also returned to her horror hosting gig in 2014 for Hulu’s 13 Nights of Elvira.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Elvira-Subtly-Shades-Kylie-Jenner-for-Not-Tagging-Her-in-Flattering-Halloween-Costume-Inline.jpg><p>In her 2021 memoir, the Halloween Wars alum explained that she always wanted the character Elvira to be a symbol of empowerment even as she was showing off her assets. “Regardless of her bodacious body, she never allows herself to become a sex object,” the Pee-wee’s Big Adventure star wrote. “She unapologetically flaunts her sexiness, but is also fiercely independent, strong and self-empowered. If you reduce her to nothing more than a pair of boobs, you might miss that she’s intelligent, witty and altruistic.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Jenner’s Elvira homage was <a href=#>only one of five Halloween costumes</a> the <a href=#>Kardashians</a> star showed off this year.
