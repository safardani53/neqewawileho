Sasa Ilic, now 46, was headed towards a downward spiral after a a catalogue of catastrophic moments left him in a desperate situation.
But the former Charlton player, who made a match-winning penalty shootout save against Sunderland in the 1998 Playoff Final, didn't want to become another statistic - a broke, bankrupt footballer.
Instead, he jumped on his motorbike, rode to Montenegro and converted a home he had into a stunning 5 star boutique hotel called the Monte Bay Retreat that opened its doors in 2013 in the beautiful old town of Perast."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And I had Ronald de Boer, who is a friend of mine too, who came last year.</p><p>"But I've not really tapped into my contacts. I just want people to come because they want to come, rather than seeing big-name superstars and all that kind of stuff.</p><p>"Ronald is a friend of mine, and he was in Montenegro so he popped down to see me. And with Gary, he saw pictures on the website when I was down at Charlton for an event, so he came with his wife.</p><p>"It's one of those places that if you were a superstar, nobody will see you. So you get that intimacy that you wouldn't necessarily get anywhere else."</p><p>Ilic admitted that although he might have a tipple too many with guests every now and again, he's really living a much healthier and happier life now.</p><p>"It's a beautiful lifestyle, we eat fresh food practically every day. We go out in speedboats or I'll go out with the clients.</p><p>"I'm living the dream, I guess, on the Mediterranean coast and we're only open for seven months of the year.</p><p>"I purposefully lock it up for 5 months and go away on holiday with my wife and kids."</p><p>Being a hotel owner for Ilic isn't quite as glamorous as being a footballer, the stopper confessed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000450604605.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000322511105-e1542703629631.jpg><p>But he does get to talk about his glory days, especially with Sunderland fans who he apologises to for saving a Michael Gray penalty in the Addicks' 1998 shootout win.</p><p>"This is a close second to being a footballer," he told us.</p><p>"I think if you ask any former player if they would compare what they do now to when they were playing, nothing will come even close to being a professional footballer.</p><p>"It's the&nbsp;camaraderie, the feeling fit, it's the crowd, the adrenaline... nothing can beat that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000001582381.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000001501371.jpg><p>"But I do get to relive my football glory days with my guests. I don't really tell them I used to play, but there are some that do tend to look up the place and see I played.</p><p>"I've had some Sunderland supporters come, and when I've had a few drinks I tend to apologise to them for that penalty save I made in 1998!"</p><p>When he can, Ilic does go back to the Valley to see his old mates and speak of the "old days" over a pint of beer.</p><p>He also still plays, pulling on a shirt for Masters Football - where retired players come together for a six-a-side indoor football tournament.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in football</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000450618110.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000450602596.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000450604592.jpg><p>"It's fantastic. It's one of those things that's organised where you get to play with players you used to play against.</p><p>"So, any scuffle you may have had during your playing days with that player, you tend to talk it over and laugh about it later on.</p><p>"It's a fantastic way to travel, meet players and it's also good for the ego. We're treated like rock stars wherever we go.</p><p>"I captained a game in Hong Kong once, and it was such a great tour. When you've not in the game for so long, it's great to get that kind of attention again."</p><p><strong>For more information about Ilic's beautiful boutique hotel, visit <a href=#>Monte Bay Retreat's website</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLOwu9ObmKWkX2yEeIKQbmloq5Gorm61y6KaZpuYlr%2BtwM6nZKannqmybq7AsmSrnaSnsqLAjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
