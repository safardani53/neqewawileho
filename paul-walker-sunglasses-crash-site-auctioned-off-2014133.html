The consigner is also auctioning off a fire extinguisher and an item he simply calls "debris," all presumably from the Santa Clarita crash site.&nbsp;</p><p>The auction items come with a <a href=#>detailed description of the bystander's recollection</a> from the night of Nov. 30, when he was allegedly located near where the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT collided with a lamp post.&nbsp;</p><p>"Once the site investigation was cleared with car debris hauled away and tape taken down, a responding officer allowed him as well as others back to the public site," the site reads. "The only thing left was a charred ivy brush, minor residual debris, a knocked down pole and tree. As the consigner walked the scene in disbelief and grief, he found a pair of sunglasses nearby in the ivy. After showing one of the officers, he was waved off."</p><p>The next day the man supposedly saw photos of Walker in the sunglasses and realized what he had discovered. The auction site features photos of the dirt-covered shades up for bid. They appear to match the ones Walker was wearing in photos taken right before his death, but the frames are also pretty basic, and it's hard to read their label. Right before his death, Walker was attending a charity event for his non-profit organization, Reach Out Worldwide where he was spotted wearing the sunglasses.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"These auction items are offered with the acknowledgement of Paul Walker’s immeasurable charitable contributions," the site reads in what seems to be an attempt to deflect criticism of the rather tasteless sale. "A portion of the proceeds will benefit savethemustangs.org one of the main charities BidAMI partners with."</p><p>As of 1:20 p.m. ET the items only had four bids with the highest bid at $1,572.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapmaWherity6Scq2WjqruouMCsqp6rXZi%2For%2FHZqqirJVirrav06Kmp52UYrynsoxrZ2psYWiAcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
