Crejan, 67, showed them the wool at the Duke’s request; it just happened to be the same shade of brown as his hair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/fb4185e5d8a4764dfc44c9713596187f8fb0214a.jpg><p>“The Prince was interested in the alpaca, and as I showed it to them, the Princess said he should put it on his head,” Crejan said of <strong>Prince George</strong>‘s parents. “She said, ‘You need it more than me,’ and pointed to his head and he laughed.”</p><p>First held in 1823, the 14-day Royal Easter Show attracts more than 900,000 visitors every year and features prize-winning livestock and more than 10,000 items of produce on display. There are also interactive exhibits on pig patting and cow milking, among other things.</p><p>During their tour of the arena, the Duke and Duchess witnessed a sheep-shearing display and met Fred, a 6-year-old merino ram. Fred gave them a formal greeting, lowering himself down to one knee (with the help of his owner, sheep farmer Jim Murray).</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/e1878dd1bd6e1efd622988de3ce6d91bb6a16272.jpg><p>“He’s very intelligent, sheep are highly trainable if they’re treated right,” Murray said. “The Duke and Duchess were very impressed with his size and stature and how soft his wool was.”</p><p>The couple also took time to chat with other visitors, including Sarah Xabreyas, 8, who gifted the Duchess with a bracelet. “She was lovely, everything I thought a princess to be,” Sarah said of Middleton, 32, who wore a white lace Zimmerman dress and tan wedge <a href=# data-link=1>sandals</a>. “She actually put my bracelet on before she walked to the car.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmaSaeq61w52jnqyfo3q1scCsnKxloKe2r6%2FEZq6ipJyerq55wJumrqxdnba0ecGao51lo6W8tXmRaWhtaWhpfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
