Viewers have already seen more than enough of them to feel concerned.
But there’s more to this than 24/7 video monitoring and intense jealousy in both directions.
In a newly resurfaced video, we can see their hurtful emotional “mind games” play out."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And both given to fits of extreme jealousy and paranoia.</p><p>That is perhaps more evident in a TikTok video that Mary posted herself than it is on the show. We’ll talk about why the show isn’t like this in a moment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>In the clip, Mary simply turned off the camera while on a video call (when is she not) with Brandan.</p><p>This meant that she could watch him — but he could not watch her.</p><p>She filmed her phone on a second device, recording his reaction when he could suddenly no longer see her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/07/0713_brandan_02-1024x576.png><p>Brandan paused his eating, and she asked if he was “mad.”</p><p>He said that he was not — initially, anyway.</p><p>And he admitted that he was “overthinking” everything in the moment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/07/0711_brandan_04-1024x576.png><p>The recording, which seems to be from May of 2022, then shows Mary seem to taunt Brandan.</p><p>She asked why he couldn’t see her. In response, he pouted, reminding her that she’d told him that she had turned off her camera.</p><p>He then demanded to know why she had turned off the camera. Did she not want him to see her?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/07/0718_brandandenuccio_15-1024x576.png><p>“I want to, but I’m not pretty right now. I’m a mess now,” Mary responded. This was seemingly a lie.</p><p>Brandan became visibly upset, seeming to shake the camera while he spoke to her.</p><p>“I want to f–king see you. You’re not ugly. Don’t say that s–t,” he demanded. “It’ll make me mad if you say that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/07/0711_brandan_01-1024x576.png><p>She then encouraged Brandan to go back to eating his food. He refused, since she was not eating.</p><p>Mary encouraged Brandan, who was standing in a kitchen, to “eat [his] food,” though he refused because she wasn’t eating her own food.</p><p>Social media users, starting with <a href=#>TikToker Duuses</a> who spotted the video on the algorithmic nightmare app, discussed how effed up this was.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/07/0718_brandandenuccio_11-1024x576.png><p>First and foremost, people remarked on how toxic this “manipulative, emotional mind game thing” was.</p><p>It’s worse than just 24/7 surveillance. Because it’s surveillance with unhinged emotional spirals if the surveillance pauses at any time.</p><p>Then there’s Mary doing this on purpose to see and record a rise out of Brandan. It’s a bad look for them both.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Second, it’s a reminder that what we see on 90 Day Fiance: The Other Way is on-camera behavior, after editing.</p><p>Just because Brandan seems like a victim of Mary’s insecurities on screen does not mean that the reverse is not also true.</p><p>A number of viewers might be surprised to see this kind of instant mood swing from Brandan. He and Mary are both two sides of this very toxic coin.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>So, why isn’t this what we’re seeing from them on the show?</p><p>Well, for one thing, they both know that they’re on camera during the show.</p><p>Obviously, they act up on the show. Mary cried over Brandan talking to his dental hygienist and acknowledging that he dated once before.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>But when you’re an unreasonable person, you have a skewed idea of what’s normal to do on camera.</p><p>In this moment, on TikTok, Brandan thought that Mary was simply watching him.</p><p>He didn’t know that she was recording him. So he was, perhaps, at his most honest and unfiltered.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Of course, some fans of the show have managed to convince themselves that this relationship’s toxicity is one-sided. That Mary is the sole problem.</p><p>But actually, no, that’s not the truth.</p><p>Many audience members have issues with racism, xenophobia, and most of all, <a href=#>90 Day Fiance‘s infamous misogyny problem</a>. The show’s editing caters to that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>While it’s true that Brandan and Mary’s relationship sounds like the basis for a psychological thriller or at least a Lifetime movie, they’re not evil people.</p><p>But what they have is extremely unhealthy and toxic. And it’s destructive — not just to their other relationships and careers, but to themselves.</p><p>We would like to see things improve for them. It would be impressive if something beautiful sprouts from their twisted obsession.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2WEcK7RmqWdmZ5irq%2BwjKaYq7FdqcSqv9Oem2almaOxbrPAppysZZWtvbC%2FxJ1koqZdpb%2BmeZhpZJ2ZqWKzqq3NnJxmrpmZsrB7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
