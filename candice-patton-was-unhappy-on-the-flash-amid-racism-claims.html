It was just free range to get abused every single day.”</p><p class=p1>She continued: “It’s a <a href=#>dangerous place to be in</a> when you’re one of the first, and you’re facing backlash for it and there’s no help. Now, people understand a little better and they understand how fans can be racist, especially in genre, and misogynistic. But at the time it was kind of like: ‘Yeah that’s how fans are, but whatever.’”</p><p class=p1>After allegedly dealing with rampant racism regarding her casting as <a href=#>the love interest of Barry Allen/The Flash</a> (<a href=#><strong>Grant Gustin</strong></a>), the&nbsp;<i>Game&nbsp;</i>alum also felt a lack of support from her employers. (The CW and Warner Bros. have yet to publicly address her claims.)</p><p class=p1>“I wanted to leave the show as early as season two. I remember being like: ‘I can’t do this, I’m not gonna make it through, I’m severely unhappy,’” she claimed to podcast host <strong>Elliot Knight</strong>. “It was more about the protocols in place and the things I see happening for my white counterpart that’s not happening to me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/The-Flashs-Candice-Patton-Says-She-Was-Treated-Differently-Than-Her-White-Costars-Inline.jpg><p class=p1>Patton further alleged: “Seeing how I was treated differently than other people. Seeing how I’m not protected by the network and the studio. Those were the things that not necessarily hurt me but frustrated me. … With the companies I was working with like CW and Warner Brothers, that [‘whatever’] was their way of handling it. I think we know better now that it’s not okay to treat your talent that way and to let them go through this abuse and harassment.”</p><p class=p1>Her character has been <a href=#>a constant presence on the Arrowverse show</a> following its 2014 premiere, where she eventually falls in love with Barry before they welcome daughter Nora (<a href=#><strong>Jessica Parker Kennedy</strong></a>) and son Bart (<a href=#><strong>Jordan Fisher</strong></a>) in flash-forward sequences. The show, which <a href=#>aired its season 8 finale in June</a>, saw Iris notably absent from four consecutive episodes this past season when she suffered from “time sickness,”&nbsp; disappearing into the Still Force.</p><p class=p1>“My s8 contract was designed by myself & my team in such a way to protect myself in the event that <a href=#>the borders between Canada and the US closed again</a> [due to COVID-19 restrictions],” Patton addressed her absence in a July 1 <a href=#>Instagram Story</a> post, referring to the show’s Canadian filming location. “My team and I made it clear at the time of negotiations/signing & throughout the season that should the coronavirus & border situation around summer/fall of 2021 continue to stay optimistic (and it was clear early on that it would) that I would be happy to be featured in all episodes.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The Mississippi native added at the time: “That <a href=#>option was ultimately not exercised</a> & we respected that decision! I hope that offers clarity and really hope everyone enjoyed the season overall!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacmZ6ZtqSxjKmYrayfo3q4rdJmrKegkaW9unnOp2StoJVis62t0qFkmqWZmXqzrcKiqqZlk6GuqrnSaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
