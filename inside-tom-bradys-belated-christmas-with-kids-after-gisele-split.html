Brady was joined <a href=#>by son Benjamin, 13, and daughter Vivian, 10,</a> whom he shares with Bündchen, 42. His 15-year-old son Jack, who he shares with ex <a href=#><strong>Bridget Moynahan</strong></a>, was also part of the festivities.</p><p>Earlier this month, Brady opened up about <a href=#>spending Christmas on the football field instead of with his loved ones.</a></p><p>“It’ll be a new experience that I’ve never had before that I’m gonna learn how to deal with. And I think that’s what life’s about. So you just asked a question about what have you learned from this football season? I’m gonna learn how to deal with Christmas Eve in a hotel, and I’m gonna have to learn how to deal with Christmas and Christmas night and still go out there and be a professional,” he said on his SiriusXM’s “Let’s Go! with Tom Brady, Larry Fitzgerald and Jim Gray” podcast. “And then look forward to celebrating Christmas with my kids the day after. Which is, you know, just part of what football season has been for a long time. So it’s just, again, emotional aspects that allow us to thrive.”</p><p>While the Buccaneers quarterback played against the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday, December 25, <a href=#>his ex-wife shared photos from her holiday getaway with their children</a>. “It’s my Rio Grande do Sul Heaven, Sun, South, Earth and Color Where everything that is planted grows and what blooms the most is love,” the model wrote alongside an Instagram post on Tuesday. “It’s always so good to come back home❤️ Always so good to be back home.”</p><p>The former Victoria’s Secret Angel uploaded <a href=#>several snaps of her enjoying her time in Brazil</a>. “Recharging with my little ones in the country of my ❤️!” she captioned a December 18 post about her trip.</p><p>Brady and Bundchen, who tied the knot in 2009, <a href=#>shocked fans when they announced their divorce</a> in October.</p><p>“In recent days, my wife and I finalized our divorce from one another after 13 years of marriage,” the California native wrote in a statement. “We arrived at this decision amicably and with gratitude for the time we spent together. We are blessed with beautiful and wonderful children who will continue to be the center of our world in every way. We will continue to work together as parents to always ensure they receive the love and attention they deserve.”</p><p>At the time, Brady noted that <a href=#>it was “painful and difficult” to end his marriage</a>, adding, “However, we wish only the best for each other as we pursue whatever new chapters in our lives that are yet to be written. And we kindly ask for privacy and respect as we navigate what is to come in the days and weeks ahead. Thank you.”</p><p>The Super Bowl champ later <a href=#>opened up about keeping his focus on his kids and his career.</a></p><p>“Obviously, the good news is it’s a very amicable situation and I’m really focused on two things, taking care of my family and certainly my children,” he shared on his podcast at the time. “We all have our unique challenges in life. We’re all humans. We do the best we could do.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He concluded: “I have incredible parents that have always taught me the right way to do things. I want to be a great father to my children and always try to do things the right way as well.”</p><p>Scroll down to see Brady’s belated Christmas gathering with his kids:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNktq%2B%2FyJ2cZqyfonqjvsCdsKxlkpq5osDEnWScoKKewLW5wKxksKGknXqstcOsZJqepJq%2FbrPIrJylnV2ova2102g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
