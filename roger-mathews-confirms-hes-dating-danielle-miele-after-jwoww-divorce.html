The former couple <a href=#>accused each other of abuse</a> in since-deleted <a href=#>blog posts</a> in early 2019, but they ultimately managed to put their differences aside for the sake of their two children.</p><p>“She is being an adult about the divorce and working toward <a href=#>being better coparents</a>,” the Jersey Shore: Family Vacation star’s rep said in a statement to Us in April 2019. “As far as the divorce, there is no reconciliation in the future, and she is excited about continuing to move on with her life.”</p><p>Mathews, for his part, told Us exclusively in September 2019, “Jenni and I will forever be <a href=#>tied by two beautiful children</a> we love so much, and I am sure we will coparent amazing together.”</p><p>Farley has also moved on since her separation from Mathews. She <a href=#>started dating</a> <a href=#><strong>Zack Clayton Carpinello</strong></a> in March 2019.
