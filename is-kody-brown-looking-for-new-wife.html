In fact, Kody appeared to repudiate them in August of 2023, when he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>: "The idea of ever marrying again after the experience I’ve had, there’s no reason for me to do that. I feel like I've hit the bottom of a deep swimming pool, but I've pushed off and am headed to the surface."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kody is apparently interested in reconciling with Janelle.</h2><p>Although Kody may not be looking to add a new wife to the family, he has expressed interest in rekindling his relationship with Janelle. As he told people in August of 2023, he hopes to "negotiate [a] reconciliation“ between him and Janelle. "It's been a dark time but I'm moving forward," he added.</p><p>He also admitted that a lot would have to change in order for things between him and Janelle to progress. “I have to find a new normal with Janelle because even if Janelle and I reconcile our marriage, it's still going to be a new normal because it's going to be different from where we've been before,” he said. “Because how it was working for us didn't seem like it was quite right. It wasn't whole.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Kody Brown still believe in polygamy?</h2><p>In earlier seasons of Sister Wives, Kody had a "never say never" outlook on the possibility of adding a <a href=#>fifth sister wife</a> to the family. But as the Brown family patriarch's marriages were rocked by disagreements over COVID-19 stipulations, he has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">become increasingly disenchanted with polygamy</a>. The events featured in Season 17 did nothing to help this stance.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In Part 3 of the Sister Wives: One on One for Season 17, host <a href=#>Sukanya Krishnan</a> asked the TLC stars about whether Kody would pursue polygamy again in the future.</p><p>"I think a part of him always would be a little bit sad that this didn't work and that the big family didn't work. And I think that there would be a little bit of a mourning and a little bit of a loss there still," Christine told Sukanya. "Because it's a dream, right? It's giving up on a dream. And it's not a dream they wanted to give up on, necessarily."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"I don't see them looking for another wife after this," Christine added. "It's a lot of work and if you already have this much failure behind you, would you really want that again? If they're just happy with each other — and I perceive them as being soulmates with each other — is there room for anybody else, really?"</p><p>Robyn weighed in on whether Kody would potentially seek out more wives in the future, too. "I don't know. He has basically said no," she told Sukanya.</p><p>Still, Robyn said she could see herself asking Kody to try polygamy again — although there's some hesitation on her part, as well. She explained, "I'm scared because of how badly this has gone."</p><p>Catch new episodes of Sister Wives on Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC and Discovery Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBut86dsGaaoqTEr3nLqKakoZ6ceqe70Walnq9drLansQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
