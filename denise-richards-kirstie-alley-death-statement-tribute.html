The RHOBH alum took to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> on Tuesday, Dec. 6 to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>share her thoughts</a>. “Kirstie is one of the funniest, nicest & strongest women I’ve ever met,” she wrote. “I am so lucky & grateful that I got to do a movie with her playing my mom. I was quite intimidated to work with her but she immediately made me feel so comfortable. She had a heart of gold & deep love for animals. Her laugh was infectious & she lit up every room she walked into. Kirstie you are loved by so many & will be so very missed. Prayers to your kids & grandkids.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Denise’s statement comes after she starred with Kirstie in 1999’s Drop Dead Gorgeous&nbsp;with the late actress. In the mockumentary, Denise played pageant contestant Rebecca Ann “Becky” Leeman, who was the daughter of Kirstie’s character, Gladys Leeman. Gladys was the head of the pageant organizing committee and a former pageant winner. The funny feature made a lasting impression and remains a fan favorite of both Denise and Kirstie’s followers.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Denise’s loving words about Kirstie were just some of the many words that were shared by some of Kirstie’s other co-stars and friends. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>John Travolta</strong></a>, who starred in the Look What’s Talking movies with the beauty, immediately took to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> to share memorable photos of her and a heartbreaking caption. <span>“Kirstie was one of the most special relationships I’ve ever had. I love you Kirstie.

She was a great comic foil in @tvscreamqueens and a beautiful&nbsp;mama bear in her very real life,” Jamie wrote. “She helped me buy onesies for my family that year for Christmas. We agreed to disagree about some things but had a mutual respect and connection. Sad news.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Like Jamie, <strong>Abigail Breslin</strong> starred with Kirstie in Scream Queens and took to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> to share <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a tribute</a>. “RIP @kirstiealley you were a great lady. I’m so happy I got to work with you on&nbsp;Scream Queens season 2 and always chuckled at the way you put your name in my phone. I hope you’re resting peacefully now. Love to Kirsties family and friends. Xx”, she wrote alongside a screenshot of&nbsp;Kirstie’s phone contact which read, “Kirstie (like thirsty).”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Denise-Richards-Kirstie-Alley-Tribute-EV-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Kirstie’s death was announced by her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>son, <strong>William</strong>, and daughter, <strong>Lillie</strong></a>, in a tweet on her official Twitter account on Dec. 5. “To all our friends, far and wide around the world… We are sad to inform you that our incredible, fierce and loving mother has passed away after a battle with cancer, only recently discovered,” the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>statement</a> read. “She was surrounded by her closest family and fought with great strength, leaving us with a certainty of her never-ending joy of living and whatever adventures lie ahead.
