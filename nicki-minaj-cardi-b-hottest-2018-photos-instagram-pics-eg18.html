Cardi wasn’t one of those celebs who kept her pregnant belly hidden from the public, meaning she consistently showed it off in Instagram pics and on Rolling Stone covers."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But after welcoming daughter&nbsp;<strong>Kulture Kiari Cephus</strong> into the world with&nbsp;<strong>Offset</strong> in July, the “Bodak Yellow” hitmaker got back into shape and started flaunting her flat post-baby abs on the social media platform.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>One of our favorite looks of hers came on Sept. 30 when she shared a pic of herself rocking a red push-up bra, and matching fringe jacket and pants. “MOST HATED BITCH ON THE PLANET,” she captioned it. Well we certainly don’t hate her!</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Nicki also showed off her impressive cleavage on the ‘gram earlier in the year. On May 17, she dropped a pic of herself rocking a sheer black top with a velvet eagle on the front and captioned it, “I look beyond what ppl sayin & I see intent. Then I just sit back & decipher what they really meant.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>But while we’re taking a look back at these two, can we just take a second to remember that Cardi threw a shoe at Nicki at&nbsp;Harper Bazaar‘s ICONS party during New York Fashion Week in September? Because that happened this year. And it… was wild. Unfortunately, I don’t have an entire gallery dedicated to that but I can offer you one that includes the rappers’ sexiest Instagram pics of 2018! Go check it out above! May 2019 be filled with more Cardi and Nicki photos.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWloZH5ze5BwZqehk6C2brnIp5ijZZOWv6W1jJtkoaekqbK0wIxrZ2pwXaW1sMDOrGSipqOprqi%2BwKZkqaGTqHqms5BxZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
