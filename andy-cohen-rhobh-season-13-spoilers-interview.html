In addition, the&nbsp;Daddy Diaries&nbsp;author explained that after the intense&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vanderpump Rules</a>&nbsp;Season 10 reunion, he enjoyed a Fresca Mixed to decompress. “I had a Fresca Mixed!”, he joked before adding, “Or two!” Despite all the drama with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#Scandoval</a>, Andy admitted that he was more “stressed” after&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</a>&nbsp;Season 13 <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>reunion</a>. “I was more stressed out after the Jersey reunion, to be honest,” he said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Of course, we also made sure to ask if fans can expect <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Melissa Gorga</a>&nbsp;</strong>or&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Teresa Giudice</strong></a> to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>make an exit</a> amid their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ongoing feud</a>, however, Andy explained that things are still up in the air. “I think everything’s a possibility,” the 55-year-old noted. “We’re just kind of taking a beat right now as we do between seasons.” The proud father made sure to also touch upon the scandalous season of&nbsp;VPR&nbsp;and said he is looking forward for the cast to be able to “live their life” after the shocking <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>cheating scandal</a> surrounding <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tom Sandoval</strong></a> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Raquel Leviss</strong></a>. “I’m happy for them all just to have a little time to themselves to kind of figure things out,” he said. “I think there’s been an incredible amount of scrutiny on them and conversation that they all deserve to kind of just live their life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/andy-cohen-excited-for-shift-in-rhobh-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>This year has certainly been a busy one for Andy, as not only did he release his book The Daddy Diaries: The Year I Grew Up on May 9, but he has also had to deal with tons of Bravo drama. As previously mentioned, Melissa and Teresa have had an ongoing feud and went at it during <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the reunion</a> earlier this month. Tom and <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ariana Madix </a></strong>broke up at the start of Mar. after it was revealed that he <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>cheated on her</a> with Raquel. And not to mention, the queen of “Owning It!” announced <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her exit</a> from&nbsp;RHOBH after eight iconic seasons. And to top it all off,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Real Housewives of Orange County</a>&nbsp;returned on Jun. 7.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Aside from work, Andy recently celebrated his 55th birthday and took to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> with his friend&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Anderson Cooper</strong></a>, 56, on Jun. 1 to celebrate. “Gemini Twins! #GoofusAndGallant #AC2,” he captioned the video. Anderson notably also celebrated his birthday two days later on Jun. 3. In the clip, Andy revealed that he treated Anderson to dinner and they enjoyed a “nice” outing in New York City. The two TV personalities can often be spotted hanging out and sharing photos of each other via social media.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH13e5FsZpqmlK56pLvHnqVmqpikr6l50p6YrKeeYn50edKppqKklafAbrXNrZyrrpmaxHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
