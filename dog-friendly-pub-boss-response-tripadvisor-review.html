If you like a dog barking at your table begging for food off your plate... then hey ho maybe for you..."</p><p>He added: "The young waiters/waitresses were fine but when we asked for the dessert menu... we were told the kitchen had closed. Our table was booked at 8pm for my wife's birthday, we had starters, mains and several glasses of wine, drinks etc.</p><p>"Steve rudely explained that the chef had been in all day and was wanting to get home...

It's a dog friendly pub.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>"He continued to emphasise that his customers come for the food... which was OK #standard.
