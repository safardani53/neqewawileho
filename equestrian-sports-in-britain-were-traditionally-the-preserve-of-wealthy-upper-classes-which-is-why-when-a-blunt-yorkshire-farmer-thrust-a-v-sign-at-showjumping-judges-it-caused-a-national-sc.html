Germany dominated the Berlin Olympics in 1936, while Britain topped the medal table for the first time at Mexico in 1968.</p><p>Three years later, at Hickstead, Sussex, Harvey Smith shattered showjumping’s genteel atmosphere by showing the V-sign to a line of judges after completing his winning round at the British Show Jumping Derby, an event he won seven times.</p><p>Smith had earlier had a heated row with a judge after neglecting to bring along the trophy, which he had won the year before.</p><p>The judges believed he was arrogant enough to assume he would retain it – which, to his evident satisfaction, he then did.</p><p>Smith cheekily claimed he was evoking Churchill’s “V for victory” sign but was stripped of his title and the £2,000 winners’ cheque.</p><p>There was a public outcry and amid huge popular support Smith’s disqualifi cation was reversed - although much later he admitted the V-sign WAS the defiant gesture everyone suspected.</p><p>Doing a “Harvey Smith” became a recognised phrase which is still in some dictionaries.</p><p>Between them Smith and Princess Anne propelled show-jumping into the spotlight during 1971.</p><p>Anne (who later competed at the 1976 Montreal Olympics) won the individual title at the European Eventing Championships at Burghley House, Lincolnshire, and was crowned BBC Sports Personality of the Year.</p><p>Her daughter Zara won the same BBC award 35 years later after a spectacular display at the 2006 World Equestrian Games where she won the individual gold.</p><p>Without doubt the most revered rider on the eventing circuit was New Zealander Mark Todd, voted rider of the 20th Century by the FEI in 2000.</p><p>Todd won the individual gold at both the 1984 and 1988 Olympics.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/jump2_1765239a.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/jump3_1765238a.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/jump4_1765237a.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfnbytsIyynGaeoqS7tXnPmp6eZ2JmfXOBkXBmnqmlmsC1vsiapWaroKS%2Ftb%2BMoqVmmqKewaK1zWaunqqVYsGzrcOiq6Knnpa5rcWMrZ%2BeZaCnsrSx0a%2BcZqeWYsSmrcutn7JlpaW9pr6MnKOaq6OawG7Dx6KaoWWZqHq4tNhmrqGdnmKubq7LrqWtZamkv6y%2Fx6KpnmWWlr%2BusdFmq6GqpajBbq2Mr2SsoZejeqLAjKyfqK%2Baqrqxtc2gZKOtlJyytHnIrWScmaWosqV5wGalmqyZpLuiuIysmmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
