All About The Author</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-04-26</div><p>In recent days, there has been a tremendous demand to watch the Harriet Sergeant Wikipedia page. According to Wikipedia and Age, this essay will help you discover more about the famed journalist and novelist Harriet Sergeant. Harriet Sergeant is a journalist, author, and research associate at the Centre for Policy Studies, a non-profit think tank.</p><p>Her most recent work, a thriller co-written with Marlon Campbell called Parrots Over Babylon, was published in 2017. Her first book, released in 1985, was an examination of South Africa’s apartheid regime. Her three books are the outcome of her inquiry and conversations with individuals. Parrots Over Babylon is a tense thriller as well as a romantic mystery. The first female mayor of London is forced to collaborate with a criminal to discover who murdered her love.</p><p>One of her books, Among the Hoods, published by Faber in 2012, chronicles her twelve-year affiliation with a south London gang, which began while I was researching why so many black Caribbean and white working-class guys are failing.&nbsp;She has written for publications such as the Sunday Times, Financial Times, Daily Mail, Sun, Spectator, and Standpoint. She often participates in TV and radio programs such as Any Questions, Question Time, Newsnight, and Today, among others. She has also been featured often in the Sky Paper Review. Harriet’s publications are all published by the Centre for Policy Studies and may be bought in print form or downloaded for free.</p><h2>Harriet Sergeant Wiki and Age</h2><p>Nothing has been written about Harriet Sergeant on Wikipedia. In all forms of media, the journalist has avoided reporting her age. She hasn’t revealed any personal information about her family or age. Her images, however, show that she is in her mid-50s. She majored in English at Oxford’s St. Catherine’s College.&nbsp;Harriet’s debut novel was set in apartheid-era South Africa, where she lived for a year in the 1980s. After seven years in Japan, she released a narrative of her experiences as well as a history of Shanghai in the 1920s and 1930s.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Harriet-Sergeant-1.jpg alt="Harriet Sergeant" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She recently completed five research projects at the Centre for Policy Research. They’ve spoken about immigration, NHS management, health tourism, children in care, and education, specifically why working-class boys of color and white Caribbean men suffer in school and at work.&nbsp;The Harriet Sergeant Wikipedia page is currently unavailable. As a consequence, learning from the journalist is difficult for readers and followers.</p><h2>More about Harriet Sergeant, Journalist, and Author</h2><p>Harriet has also written a report for Civitas on the public and the police. The study focused on how the public perceives the police, as well as how objectives and government actions impact the force. Once again, these investigations incorporate research and interviews.&nbsp;Each report takes her around ten months to write and requires extensive research. This necessitated interviewing a wide range of people, including teachers, police sergeants, constables, gang members, social workers, foster youngsters, prostitutes, illegal immigrants, and many more. She enjoyed spending time in the area she writes about, so it’s more than just an interview. She has followed hospital personnel and visited schools, children’s homes, and police stations.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Harriet-Sergeant-2.jpg alt="Harriet Sergeant" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She meets with patients, crime victims, illegal immigrants, foster children, parents, and kids in inner-city schools who use these programs.&nbsp;Sergeant’s revelations have received widespread media attention, including serialization in the Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph. Five of these were published on the front page of the Daily Mail.&nbsp;Harriet Sergeant Wikipedia will soon be promoted on the official site if Wikipedia admins recognize the journalist and provide her biography and professional achievements.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGifmqqinrK1edKeqaCdkaPBbsPIpKBmoJ%2BserC4w2agrGWjnbJurculZJqan6rBbsDHnmSaraSdvLN7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
