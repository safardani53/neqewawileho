French-Caribbean musician Joseph Bologne, Chevalier de Saint-Georges, was a free man of color, champion fencer, violinist, and composer. He was born in Guadeloupe to the son of Georges de Bologne Saint-Georges and an enslaved woman named Nanon.</p><p>By the age of thirteen, however, he had moved to France and began schooling at a private boarding school, where he learned horse riding, fencing, and dancing. After enrolling in fencing school at thirteen, Joseph quickly climbed the ranks and began beating accomplished swordsmen at fifteen.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Searchlight Pictures</span></figure><p style=text-align:start>One of Joseph's most famous fencing matches took place in 1761 against fencing master Alexandre Picard, who reportedly referred to Joseph with racist and derogatory terms. According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Los Angeles Opera</a>, upon winning, Joseph was named a member of the King's bodyguard and an official chevalier (a knight). Joseph then adopted the title of his father, de Saint-Georges.</p><p>Despite his fencing talents, Joseph's passion lay in music. In 1969 he joined a symphony of amateur performers, and two years later, he was appointed concertmaster and began composing. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a>, Joseph even developed a fierce rivalry with none other than Mozart.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Searchlight Pictures</span></figure><p>As an admired figure in court for his sportsmanship and musical talents, sadly, Joseph got into trouble later in life for his paramour. Joseph allegedly had an affair with the Marquise Marie-Josephine de Montalembert, the wife of an older general and another court staple. In the film, Marie-Josephine is played by Samara Weaving.</p><p>During the French Revolution, he served as a colonel for the Legion de Saint Georges, which was a regiment comprised entirely of people of color. Joseph was ultimately a victim of the Reign of Terror and stripped of his social and military titles when he died in 1799.</p><p>If you're curious to know more details about Joseph's exciting life, don't forget to check out the movie Chevalier.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLWmwsCloJ6qXaK8t7XEZqurrZViwLW70bI%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
