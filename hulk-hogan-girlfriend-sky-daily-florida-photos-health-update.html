At the time, Kurt claimed that Hulk’s “nerves” had been affected due to the procedure. “Hogan had his back surgery again. He had the nerves cut from his lower body,” he alleged on the episode. “He can’t feel his lower body. He has to use his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>cane to walk</a> around. I thought he was using his cane because he had pain in his back. He doesn’t have any pain. He has nothing at all. He can’t feel anything. He can’t feel his legs so he has to walk with a cane, so that’s pretty serious.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Although the 54-year-old alleged that Hulk was not in tip-top health condition, the&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Hogan Knows Best&nbsp;star</a> had his reps dispute the claims to&nbsp;ET. “Everything is OK with him,” the rep confirmed on Jan. 31. “Hulk is someone with a lot of humor.” In addition, the rep clarified that Hulk can walk just fine “without a cane”, which he was notably not pictured using on Feb. 25.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hulk-hogan-with-girlfriend-sky-backgrid-emnbed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Sky and her man’s outing also comes nearly one year after Hulk took to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Twitter</a> to reveal they were dating and announce <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>his divorce</a> from&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jennifer McDaniel</strong></a>, 49. “Yo Maniacs just for the record, the Facebook and Instagram posts are of me and my girlfriend Sky, I am <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>officially divorced</a>, sorry I thought everyone already knew, love my Maniacs4Life,” he wrote on Feb. 28, 2022. Hulk and Jennifer were married from 2010 until 2021. They did not welcome any children together. Prior to that, he was married to&nbsp;<strong>Linda Hogan</strong>, 63, from 1983 to 2009. Linda and Hulk welcomed <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two kids</a>:&nbsp;<strong>Brooke</strong>, 34, and&nbsp;<strong>Nick</strong>, 32.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Most recently, Hulk made a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>surprise appearance</a> on&nbsp;WWE Raw&nbsp;on Jan. 23.
