Ever After? was filmed months ago, when many things were different.</p><p>Tiffany has been a fan favorite since she and Ronald’s story first appeared on the show.</p><p>But for some fans, what they’re

src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>On <a href=#>Season 6, Episode 6 of 90 Day Fiance: Happily Ever After?</a>, Tiffany received long-awaited good news.</p><p>Her visa application for Ronald had been accepted.</p><p>They are married, so this is a marital visa application — not the K-1 visa process from the main show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>However, this is merely the acceptance of a visa application.</p><p>In order for the visa to actually be granted, there will be additional hurdles, including Ronald’s interview.</p><p>Ronald will have to behave himself during that process, which may be a challenge for him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Additionally, Tiffany has to prove that she can financially support Ronald.</p><p>As we have seen in other storylines on this and previous seasons, money can be a real barrier for a couple to be together.</p><p>Tiffany will have to find a sponsor to cosign her application, because her income is not quite high enough on its own.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Tiffany’s mom was not going to do it.</p><p>She made it very clear that she has real concerns about Ronald, his addiction, and the future of the marriage.</p><p>As she has said before, Tiffany’s best hope for her future might not involve her husband, despite the love that they share.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>So Tiffany turned to her father, who is one of Ronald’s biggest fans.</p><p>The mother of two knows that her dad’s image of Ronald is based upon her perfect wedding day.</p><p>He doesn’t know about Ronald’s gambling addiction, his relapses, Ronald’s criminal history, or the fights and ugly breakups.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>To her credit, Tiffany sat down with her father to share all of this.</p><p>Of coruse, we haven’t seen the full scene of their conversation.</p><p>But Tiffany’s plan is to disclose everything to her dad … and hope that he’s still willing to sponsor the application.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>For some viewers, this exchange was the final straw when it comes to how they view Tiffany.</p><p>"Tiffany planned to marry Ronald and for him to apply for a visa," a Reddit user wrote while calling Tiffany a "P.O.S."</p><p>"She didn’t plan ahead as to her income & whether she could sponsor him?" the fan demanded to know.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"In the meantime, she brings her son to South Africa and introduces him to his new daddy," the fan griped.</p><p>"Then she spreads her legs & gets pregnant again, blames Ronald for his past and jerks her now two kids back to America," the Reddit denizen spat.</p><p>"Now she is manipulating her father with his guilt to help her bring Ronald to the states," they wrote, "where he will have to be financially responsible for a gambling-addicted loser."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Before we get into some of the earlier parts of the description … this is clearly not a fan of Tiffany’s.</p><p>And anyone who uses sex-shaming language like "spreads her legs" is unlikely to view any human woman positively.</p><p>But now that we have acknowledged that … is Tiffany otherwise as this raging redditor describes?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Tiffany did acknowledge that her father is currently trying to make up for lost time.</p><p>He exited her life when she was just a few years old and was not really part of it until she was already an adult and a mother.</p><p>It’s unclear if her going to him is "using his guilt," especially when she’s being fully transparent about Ronald’s history with him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Did Tiffany really not consider the financial aspects of a visa application until now?</p><p>Well … it’s possible, but realistically, of course not.</p><p>90 Day Fiance is a reality series. The people and their stories are real. That doesn’t mean that every scene is authentic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>The show is not scripted, but production will ask people to bring up specific subjects and sometimes to repeat things.</p><p>That’s the reality of filming, especially out in the world — you can’t control when a firetruck drives by mid-conversation.</p><p>But producers also want to get multiple takes to give editors the best phrasing, emphasis, and emotion to work with.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>There are a few conversation topics that are almost always indicators that production is behind it.</p><p>One is when a 90 Day Fiance star asks for or otherwise discusses money, from a loan request to surgery prices.</p><p>The other is when a star’s friends and family voice "suspicions" about the motives of one of the stars.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>That said, the show isn’t scripted — but production can ask all of the questions that they like.</p><p>Editors then remove most of those questions, leaving only the answers.</p><p>So it appears that someone on TV is bringing up the same subject again and again and again all by themselves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>But even then, it’s impossible to say that Tiffany and some other stars are only hated because of the show’s meddling.</p><p>There are underlying elements — like, obviously, a heaping pile of misogyny.</p><p>That is enough to turn simple editing into "damning footage" for some viewers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Some people already despised Tiffany — for, what, having sex with Ronald? For not raising her children in South Africa?</p><p>From that point, anything that she says or does can only compound criticisms already felt by some fans.</p><p>Tiffany has obviously made mistakes, but it would be very weird if this "villain" label catches on.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tpX2WDcMDIn52apqlis7OtzZymZnFgYrGixYyfoJqmk5p6p63VqKmirJVitKrCxKdkr6Gcoa6quoylmJudnGKvunnFnpto</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
