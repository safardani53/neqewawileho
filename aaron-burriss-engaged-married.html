Burriss had surprised her during their hike in a garden.&nbsp;</p><p>Following the announcement, the shippers of the couple were very happy to learn the happy news. However, little did they know that their happiness would be doubled in less than three days.</p><p>On Saturday, January 1, 2022, Burriss took to his Instagram handle to shock everyone with his wedding news. He had shared a series of pictures with his now-wife from their lovely wedding ceremony. “I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you Roni,” he captioned the post.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Inside Aaron Burriss and Veronica Merrell’s Wedding</h2><p>Just like their engagement news, the news of their wedding was also kept secret for a while and was only shared among their followers on January 1, 2022. But when did Veronica and Aaron get married?</p><p>Burriss and Merrell actually walked down the aisle and shared the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wedding</a> vows on December 27, 2021, around three months after they got engaged. Their marriage was held at Santa Barbara Courthouse, California.</p><p>Speaking of wedding dress, the bride looked beautiful in a white wedding gown, and the groom donned an all-black suit accompanied by a black tie. Several close friends and family members were only invited to the wedding. The duo’s pet dog was also there as “Best Dog.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Aaron-Burriss-Wife-Veronica-Merrell-wedding-pet-dog.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Aaron Burriss and his wife, Veronica Merrell, holding their pet dog at their wedding (Photo: Instagram)</p><p>The wedding ring for the bride was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">custom designed</a> by Bez Ambar Fine Jewelry, which the store went on to give a special name, The Veronica.</p><p>While announcing their wedding on January 1, 2022, Merrell took to her Instagram handle to share some lovely snaps from that day. She wrote a long but heartfelt caption to accompany those pictures.</p><p>In the caption, she mentioned how she and her now-husband kept their love life private and hadn’t shared much of their relationship online. She wrote, “We’re married!!! Ronron confirmed! For the last 4 years, I’ve been dating my best friend, and now we are husband and wife!”</p><p>“I’ve been on the internet for 10 years and started making content at age 15. Being in the spotlight, people don’t realize how much influence the internet has on your mental health, relationships, and life,” she added.</p><p>She continued, “Aaron and I decided to protect our relationship by not confirming that we were officially dating. It has been THE BEST decision, and I’ve never been happier! 10% of our relationship has been posted online, while 90% has been private and between Aaron and me.”</p><p>“It has made it so special. I’m excited for this new chapter, and we will share more about our lives with you while also keeping a healthy balance of what should be public and what should be private. Thank you to everyone who’s been so supportive of our decision!” she concluded.</p><p>The couple’s wedding was an intimate one, with only a small number of guests in attendance. Due to that, a lot of close friends and family members missed out. So, the already-married couple got married again, this time in front of their friends and family.</p><p>On October 1, 2022, Burriss uploaded a YouTube video titled ‘We Got Married Again!’ In the video, it could be seen that the people who had missed out on their wedding, probably due to the pandemic restrictions, were present and enjoying the moment.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>To get married for the second time, Burriss chose to wear a dark-brown suit and white shirt with a black bow tie. As for the bride’s wedding dress, she looked amazing in a simple yet elegant white gown.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Aaron Burriss and Veronica Merrell’s age gap and relationship details</h2><p>Before moving into their relationship, let’s learn about Veronica Merrell and Aaron Burriss age difference. Merrell was born on August 6, 1996, making her 27 years of age as of October 2023.</p><p>On the other hand, Burriss is 34 years of age as of October 2023 — he was born on February 4, 1989.

On their very first meet, they went on to spend the whole day together and roamed around the streets of the city until 3 in the morning.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Aaron-Burriss-Wife-Veronica-Merrell-New-York.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Aaron Burriss with his wife, Veronica Merrell, in New York in September 2023 (Photo: Instagram)</p><p>They spent the rest of the weekend together too. When they got back to Los Angeles, they went on their first official date, which was one of many dates they went on during the first four months. But they weren’t dating officially.</p><p>In December 2017, Merrell thought that Burriss would stay in North Carolina with his family until the end of the holidays, including New Year, as they had planned. However, he planned everything with her family and surprised her on New Year’s Eve.</p><p>On New Year’s Day, January 1, 2018, he asked her if she would become her girlfriend, to which she said yes, and they officially began dating from that day on. However, as they were keen on privacy, they didn’t announce their togetherness.</p><p>Neither of them gave out hints that they were dating each other despite featuring each other on their social media handles and YouTube channels. And though some had suspected they were together, the duo didn’t confirm anything, as mentioned by Merrell on her wedding post.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Finally, after being in a relationship for almost four years and knowing each other for more than that, on December 29, 2021, Burriss uploaded a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube video</a> where he acknowledged his relationship with Merrell and made things official to the public.</p><p>On the same day, the two also shared a series of pictures through a joint <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram post</a> and captioned it, writing, “These past 4 years have been amazing with you!”</p><p>After making their relationship public, they also announced that they got engaged and married. As for what’s happening to the husband and wife duo after the wedding, they are relishing their days as a married couple.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>As many already know, they are very private about their relationship and keep most of the details hidden from the public eye. Nonetheless, they have been opening up a bit more since they got married, which solidified their relationship.</p><p>On their respective social media handles, both Burriss and Merrell have shared multiple pictures and clips of themselves, which their fans are absolutely adoring. Going by all that, it can be assumed that they are having a blissful marital life the way they want.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK570Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZpqZoqS7bq7Uq6miq6Nisq%2BzwKCcnWWdlr%2BztcSdZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
