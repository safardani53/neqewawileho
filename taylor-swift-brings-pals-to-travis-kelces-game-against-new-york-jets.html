The women had <a href=#>hung out in New York City</a> with quarterback <a href=#><strong>Patrick Mahomes</strong></a>‘ wife <a href=#><strong>Brittany Matthews</strong></a> the night prior.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taylor-Swift-attends-football-game-with-Blake-and-Ryan.jpg><p>Swift attended the Chiefs vs. Jets game exactly one week after she <a href=#>cheered on Kelce</a> as his team played the Chicago Bears at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. She sported a <a href=#>red Chiefs windbreaker</a> while sitting with Kelce’s mother, <a href=#><strong>Donna Kelce</strong></a>, in the NFL star’s private suite and was seen enthusiastically jumping up and down when he scored a touchdown.</p><p>After the Chiefs won the game, Swift and Kelce were spotted together for the first time as <a href=#>they left the stadium</a>. They drove away in a convertible before reportedly attending an after party at a local restaurant with Kelce’s friends and family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Taylor-Swift-Sabrina-Carpenter.jpg><p>Days later, a source exclusively told Us Weekly that the pair had “been on a few dates and Taylor is smitten with him,” adding that they met through a mutual friend. “It is not serious, and Taylor is having fun right now.”</p><p>While Swift and Kelce are taking things slowly, the insider noted that “anything is possible” as the <a href=#>two are “getting closer and closer</a> every day.”</p><p>A second source told Us that the duo were “in contact for a while” before Swift attended his game at Arrowhead Stadium. “He’s thrilled she came to see him and it <a href=#>all went off perfectly</a>,” the insider revealed, sharing that neither “want to rush” their relationship. “Taylor had such a blast and got along great with his mom and friends too.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taylor-Swift-Sophie-Turner-and-Ryan-Reynolds-at-Chiefs-game.jpg><p>Kelce first expressed his interest in Swift after <a href=#>attending her Eras Tour concert</a> in Kansas City, where he had hoped to give her a <a href=#>friendship bracelet with his phone number</a> on it. “Well, I was disappointed that she doesn’t talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings,” he explained on his “New Heights” podcast in July. “So I was a little butt-hurt I didn’t get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her.”</p><p>Days before Swift showed up at Kelce’s game against the Bears, he revealed that he had <a href=#>invited her to see him play</a>. “I told her, ‘You know, I’ve seen you rock the stage in Arrowhead [Stadium], you might have to come see me rock the stage in Arrowhead and see which one’s a little more lit,’” he noted during an appearance on “The Pat McAfee Show” at the time. “So, we’ll see what happens in the near future.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Taylor-Swift-Attends-Travis-Kelces-Game-Against-New-York-Jets.jpg><p>Following Swift’s first time cheering Kelce on from the stands, his teammate Mahomes divulged that <a href=#>Kelce told him so “calmly”</a> about Swift’s expected attendance that the quarterback did not know whether he could believe the tight end.</p><p>“He told me at, like, the last minute. There are some things with Trav where he, kind of, just says it and you don’t know if it’s true or not,” Mahomes shared during a post-game press conference. “Friday, he was just like, ‘Ah, yeah, I think she’s coming to the game … this weekend’ and moved about his business. … That’s <a href=#>just Travis</a>.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatmamhvLN50rCgn6xdl7%2BqusasZKmZnKh6tbuMramarpmoeqyxy5ycrGWXlrqmecCgmKKmo6l6r7HWZrCoqptit6bA0mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
