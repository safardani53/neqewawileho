In one scene of the film, which hits theaters on May 26, Prince Eric (Jonah Hauer-King) tries to guess Ariel’s (Halle Bailey) name after she sacrifices her voice in exchange for legs, Us Weekly can confirm. Eric’s first guess is Diana, seemingly a nod to Prince Harry‘s late mother, Princess Diana."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The 2023 remake of <a href=#>The Little Mermaid</a> contains what seems to be a dig at <a href=#><strong>Princess Kate</strong></a>.</p><p>In one scene of the film, which hits theaters on May 26, Prince Eric (<strong>Jonah Hauer-King</strong>) tries to guess Ariel’s (<a href=#><strong>Halle Bailey</strong></a>) name after she sacrifices her voice in exchange for legs, Us Weekly can confirm. Eric’s first guess is Diana, seemingly a nod to <a href=#><strong>Prince Harry</strong></a>‘s late mother, <a href=#>Princess Diana</a>.</p><p>Eric guesses Catherine next, prompting a dismissive reaction from Ariel. He then concludes that her name is absolutely not Catherine. The line appears to be a dig at Kate, 41, who has had her differences with Harry, 38, and wife <a href=#><strong>Meghan Markle</strong> </a>over the years.</p><p>The movie’s protagonists have several subtle similarities to real-life royal pair Meghan and Harry as a biracial couple from two different worlds. The Suits alum even previously compared herself to the mermaid princess.</p><p>“I was sitting in Nottingham cottage and The Little Mermaid came on,” the California native recalled during her and Harry’s March 2021 CBS <a href=#>tell-all interview</a>. “It came on and I was like, ‘Well, I’m here all the time I might as well watch this,’ and I went, ‘Oh, my God, she falls in love with the prince and because of that she loses her voice.’ … But in the end, she gets her voice back.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Slamming-Princess-Kate-Little-Mermaid-Draws-Eerie-Similarities-to-Harry-and-Meghan-4.jpg><p>Meghan’s comments came after she and the Duke of Sussex — who <a href=#>tied the knot</a> in 2018 — <a href=#>stepped back</a> from their roles as senior royals in 2020. The duo have since spoken out about their negative experiences with The Firm and the U.K. media on numerous occasions.</p><p>In their December 2022 Netflix docuseries, <a href=#>Harry & Meghan</a>, the Archewell cofounders claimed that the palace <a href=#>planted false stories</a> about Meghan in the press to bury negative narratives about other royals.</p><p>“You would just see it play out, like a story about someone in the family would pop up for a minute, and they’d go, ‘We’ve got to make that go away,’ but there’s real estate on a website homepage,” the “Archetypes” podcaster alleged. “There’s real estate there on a newspaper front cover and something has to be filled in there about someone royal.”</p><p>As for The Little Mermaid’s apparent nod to acrimony between Meghan and the Duchess of Cambridge, the sisters-in-law have had their ups and downs throughout their relationship. Following the Bench author’s 2018 wedding, reports emerged that Meghan left Kate in tears after a conversation about <a href=#>Princess Charlotte</a>’s bridesmaid dress. Nearly three years later, the TIG founder addressed <a href=#>the alleged incident</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Slamming-Princess-Kate-Little-Mermaid-Draws-Eerie-Similarities-to-Harry-and-Meghan-2.jpg><p>“The reverse of that happened,” she claimed in her March 2021 CBS interview. “A few days before the wedding, she was upset about <a href=#>flower girl dresses</a> and it made me cry. It really hurt my feelings.”</p><p>Meghan added that <a href=#><strong>Prince William</strong></a>’s wife “brought me flowers and a note, apologizing” after the tense moment.</p><p>Harry, for his part, alleged in his January memoir, Spare, that he once witnessed <a href=#>Kate acting irritated</a> when Meghan asked her to borrow some lip gloss.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Kate, taken aback, went into her handbag and reluctantly pulled out a small tube,” he wrote. “Meg squeezed some onto her finger and applied it to her lips. Kate grimaced.”</p><p>Despite his estrangement from the royal family, the BetterUp CIO attended his father <a href=#><strong>King Charles III</strong></a>’s coronation earlier this month. Meghan, meanwhile, <a href=#>remained in California</a> with their children: <a href=#>son Archie</a>, 4, and <a href=#>daughter Lilibet</a>, 23 months.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatoJViu6bDjKWgraycmnqusdGmmKKcXaiyprnIp56lsV2ZtrS%2FxKxkpJmkmnqutcOdo56sn6N8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
