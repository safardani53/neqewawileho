Shannon joined the cast of <a href=#>The Real Housewives of Orange County</a> for season 9 in 2014, and <a href=#>her husband’s infidelity</a> was later documented on the Bravo series.</p><p>During season 10 in 2015, the Girlfriends Guide to Divorce alum discovered that her then-husband had been having a months-long affair. The duo opted to <a href=#>attend couples counseling</a> rather than split.</p><p>“Divorce is not an option, it has never been an option for me,” Shannon said on the show at the time. “I love my family and I will do whatever it takes to keep my family together.”</p><p>Although the couple’s relationship rebounded in the wake of the cheating scandal — they <a href=#>renewed their marriage vows</a> in 2016 — the reconciliation didn’t last. They <a href=#>announced their separation</a> in October 2017.</p><p>“After much thought and careful consideration, David and I have made the difficult decision to separate,” Shannon told BravoTV.com at the time. “We remain <a href=#>partners in parenthood</a> and are committed to raising our three daughters. This is not the future we envisioned, and we kindly ask for privacy, especially for our children, during this transitional period.”</p><p>One month later, the Bravolebrity revealed during the RHOC season 12 reunion that David had been the one to end their marriage.</p><p>“It’s <a href=#>not what I wanted</a> and it’s been really, really hard,” she shared. “We went on a trip to Hawaii, which I kind of hoped would bring everything together, but he left the trip early. And when I came home, he said, ‘We’re done.’”</p><p>The exes didn’t <a href=#>finalize their split</a> until April 2019, with a source exclusively telling Us Weekly in December 2018 that Shannon “just wants this divorce to be over” after David filed a request to <a href=#>prohibit her from consuming alcohol</a> eight hours before or during her time with their children. “He is <a href=#>dragging it out</a> and doing whatever he can so he doesn’t have to pay her out,” the insider added.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Beador Construction Inc. founder moved on with <a href=#><strong>Lesley Beador</strong></a> (née Cook) after the split, exchanging vows with the actress in October 2020. David <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> from Lesley — with whom he welcomed daughter Anna Love in February 2021 — in September 2022.</p><p>Keep scrolling for a look back at Shannon and David’s ups and downs over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwKmtzaemp2WSmq6lu9FmmKecXZrFbrTUrJmappRisaLCyJ1km52Rmbyzv4yup6xlkaOxbrDOsKWsZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
