Following in the footsteps of giants like the late <strong>Maya Angelou</strong> (who spoke at President <strong>Bill Clinton’s</strong> 1993 inauguration), she focused on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>unity and faith</a> overcoming division.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/joe-biden-kamala-harris-inauguration-day-2021-Amanda-Gorman-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>And, just as she indicated in a Jan. 19 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The New York Times</a>, the National Youth Poet Laureate refused to “gloss over” the insurrection that took place in Washington D.C. just two weeks earlier when MAGA-supporting rioters stormed the Capitol building.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>In an excerpt from The Hill We Climb (which you can see her recite in full in the video above), she said:</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“We’ve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it,</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>And this effort very nearly succeeded.</p><p data-reader-unique-id=20>But while democracy can be periodically delayed,</p><p data-reader-unique-id=21>It can never be permanently defeated.</p><p data-reader-unique-id=22>In this truth, in this faith, we trust.</p><p data-reader-unique-id=23>For while we have our eyes on the future,</p><p data-reader-unique-id=24>history has its eyes on us.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>It was a soaring poem that <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>left Hamilton fans</a> in a frenzy after she referred to the Broadway smash hit on more than one occasion. “Loved the ‘History has its eyes on you’ nod,” CNN’s <strong>Dana Bash</strong> tweeted moments afterwards.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Loved the “History has its eyes on you” nod</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>— Dana Bash (@DanaBashCNN) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>January 20, 2021</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-12>“So much to love about poet Amanda Gorman, age 22. I’m struck by her echoing lines from the Bible and the musical Hamilton: ‘Sit under our own vine and fig tree.’ ‘History has its eyes on you,’” Fordham University law professor, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jed Shugerman</strong>, tweeted</a>. “A thread connecting Old Testament to 1776 & 1787 to our modern diverse America.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>In fact the star and Hamilton creator, <strong>Lin-Manuel Miranda</strong> heaped praise on the young poet who, like President Biden, suffered from a stutter when she was younger. “You were perfect. Perfectly written, perfectly delivered. Every bit of it. Brava! -LMM,” he tweeted at the poet after she confessed to him that she “couldn’t help” herself by including Hamilton references.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>You were perfect.

As she stood before the first African-American, South Asian, female Vice President, she noted her own historic role. Calling herself a “skinny Black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother” who “can dream of becoming president, only to find herself reciting for one.” Watch Gorman recite The Hill We Climb, in full, above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH1ye5FpZpqlkaOxonnGqKmmmZ5itq%2Bt1KCsq5mknryvec%2BonKZlpJ2ybrTIpaNmr5VisK21zJtkr6GUmrxw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
