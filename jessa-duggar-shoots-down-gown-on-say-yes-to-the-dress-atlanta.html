That’s not really what you should look like on your wedding day.“</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Jessa-Duggar-Shoots-Down-Sister-in-Law-Gown-on-Say-Yes-to-the-Dress-Inline.jpg><p>However, the&nbsp;<a href=#>Counting On</a>&nbsp;star acknowledges that she loves “the cut of the skirt and all that.”</p><p>Jessica uses the opportunity to reintroduce the idea of the first gown. “I like the first dress better than this one,” she reveals. “I cannot get that first dress out of my mind.”</p><p>Duggar and Ben, 24, tied the knot in November 2014 and went on to welcome son Spurgeon, 4, <a href=#>son Henry</a>, 3, and <a href=#>daughter Ivy</a>, 9 months.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The reality star opened up exclusively to&nbsp;Us&nbsp;in July 2018 about her go-to marriage advice. “<a href=#>Never stop showing gratitude to your spouse</a> for all the things they do to help out,” she noted at the time. “It doesn’t matter how big or small. Sometimes couples come to expect things of each other and they stop noticing and appreciating things the other one does to help out with the kids or keep the household running smoothly.”</p><p>Season 11 of&nbsp;Say Yes to the Dress: Atlanta&nbsp;premieres on TLC Saturday, March 21, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGeq6OWeqXBxqCYq2WjnbywwNJmm6ivnmK0sMPNZqanZaOWxm7FxKxkraddqbWmecOrnKyrXZbBra3NrZho</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
