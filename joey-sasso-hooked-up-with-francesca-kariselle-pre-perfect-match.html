And boy did we have a good time together,” he teased.</p><p>When asked whether he was surprised that Kariselle, 27, was willing to give him a shot inside the villa after their messy pre-show romance, he told Us “yes and no.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Joey-Sasso-on-Past-Romances-With-%E2%80%98Perfect-Match-Costars-Francesca-Farago-and-Kariselle-Snow-2.jpg><p>“Here’s the thing, we both have things that have happened in the past with each other, and I just felt that if she is here right now, I’m gonna give it my all to really try to make this work with her,” he explained. “Because it felt like life had really brought us together for a reason, especially this time. And this just felt like the time when I gotta step up, be a man, own my past.”</p><p>Joey announced in November 2022 that he was two years sober.</p><p>“I’ve really worked hard to try to get over so many things, so many mistakes from my past,” he continued. “And I felt like being on Perfect Match really gave me that opportunity to do that with her.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Fans will have to keep watching Perfect Match to see what happens with Joey and Kariselle — and the other Netflix stars who pair up to try to find The One.</p><p>The first four episodes of Perfect Match are now streaming on Netflix.
