So, if you are looking for a new slot to play on desktop or mobile, Big Bass Bonanza could well be for you.&nbsp;</p><h2>Best online casinos in the UK for playing Big Bass Bonanza</h2><h2>Big Bass Bonanza game overview</h2><p>Before we get into the heart of our Big Bass Bonanza review, we will provide a useful overview of the slot. With a fishing theme, the game features 5 reels, 4 rows and 10 paylines. Big Bass Bonanza has an RTP of 96.71%, which is around the average for <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">online slots</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Both free spins and multipliers can be won in-game, helping to bring the maximum win up to 4,000x. Bets can be placed from £0.11 to £250 per spin. The following is a breakdown of Big Bass Bonanzas’ key characteristics:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Developer</strong>: Pragmatic Play</li><li><strong>Slot type</strong>: Video slot</li><li><strong>RTP</strong>: 96.71%</li><li><strong>Theme</strong>: Fishing</li><li><strong>Reels</strong>: 5</li><li><strong>Paylines</strong>: 10</li><li><strong>Volatility</strong>: High</li></ul><h2>What are the wager limits for the Big Bass Bonanza slot game?</h2><p>As we have already mentioned, Big Bass Bonanza is a slot that will appeal to both beginners and high rollers. This is because bets per spin start at £0.11, rising to as high as £250. In order to receive a payout, you must match at least three symbols on a payline.&nbsp;</p><p>10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace act as the low-paying symbols. Meanwhile, higher paying symbols are a bass, dragonfly, rod and float. Through the Big Bass scatter, you can earn free spins. To make things easier, you can also take advantage of an autoplay feature.&nbsp;</p><p>This is available up to a maximum of 100 spins. Below, we have outlined the possible bets with the Big Bass Bonanza slot, as well as the maximum win:</p><ul><li>Minimum stake: £0.10</li><li>Maximum stake: £250</li><li>Maximum win: 2,100x</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/thesun-play-big-bass-bonanza.jpg><h2>What is the theme of the Big Bass Bonanza slot game?&nbsp;</h2><p>While Big Bass Bonanza has a fishing theme, it will also appeal to those who do not have an interest in this pastime. This is due to the excellent gameplay, as well as the outstanding visuals. The reels are transparent, meaning that players can see what is going on behind them too.&nbsp;</p><p>Set underwater, with reflecting palm trees, Pragmatic Play has done an excellent job in terms of how the game looks. All symbols relate to the theme, while the electro soundtrack and extra effects are also in keeping with the game. Such factors only make playing Big Bass Bonanza all the more appealing.&nbsp;</p><h2>What symbols are used in the Big Bass Bonanza slot game?</h2><p>As with any slot, Big Bass Bonanza features different symbols, which will land on the reels with each spin. There are both traditional symbols, as well as high-paying fishing-related symbols. The payouts vary between symbols, as well as whether 3, 4 or 5 symbols are matched. The following is a breakdown of how symbols found with Big Bass Bonanza pay:</p><ul><li><strong>10, J, Q, K & A</strong> - x50, x250 & x1,000</li><li><strong>Bass </strong>- x100, x500 & x2,000</li><li><strong>Dragon Fly</strong> - x200, x1,000 & x5,000</li><li><strong>Rod </strong>- x300, x1,500 & x10,000&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Float </strong>- x500, x2,500 & 20,000x&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Scatter </strong>- 10, 15 & 20 free spins</li></ul><h2>Can you play Big Bass Bonanza on a mobile device?</h2><p>Absolutely. As with the <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">vast majority of slots today</a>, it is possible to play Big Bass Bonanza on mobile devices.
