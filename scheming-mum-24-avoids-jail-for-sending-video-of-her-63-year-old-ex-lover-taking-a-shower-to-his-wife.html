I no longer wish to be in contact with Melissa and will sort out contact through the courts."</p><p><a href=#>The incident came three years after Thomas, a former tourism student, waged an 11 month hate campaign against another man after she was caught vandalising his front garden.</a></p><p>She had initially falsely accused the victim of assaulting her then was said to have created a Facebook page in his name so she could post abusive messages to her own account - and pretend they came from him.</p><p>As a result of the lies, the man was arrested four times wrongly charged with common assault and spent a total of 30 hours in a police cell before police found evidence which backed up his denials. In March 2013 Thomas was given a two year suspended prison term.</p><p><strong>We pay for your stories! Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team?
