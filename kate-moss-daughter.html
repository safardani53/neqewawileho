Meet Lila Grace Moss Hack.</h2><p>Although Kate has been moving in famous circles for years now, the last few have seen a rise in appearances from her daughter, Lila Grace Moss Hack. Many fans first took note of her back in 2018 when she was announced as the new face of Marc Jacobs Beauty.</p><p>Lila's first cover shoot came that same year when she modeled for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dazed</a> for its winter issue.</p><p>She then attended Marc Jacobs and Char Defrancesco's wedding in 2019 alongside her mother and other high-profile guests like <a href=#>Bella Hadid</a> and <a href=#>Naomi Campbell</a>, per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Evening Standard</a>.</p><p>One look at her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> shows that things have been on an upward swing for Lia ever since. She has modeled for the likes of Fendi, Rimowa, Miu Miu, and other major fashion industry players.</p><p>On top of that, Lila secured her first-ever Vogue cover shoot for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue Japan</a> in 2021, a massive feat for any model. She then secured yet a cover for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">British Vogue</a> in May 2022.</p><p>Lila also notably attended the 2022 Met Gala alongside her mother, and actually received quite a bit of press for the fact that she wore an insulin pump on the red carpet for fashion's biggest night, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Glamour</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>For the record, Lila has type I diabetes, meaning that her pancreas doesn’t produce enough insulin, which is needed to regulate glucose levels in a person's blood. Lila opened up about it in a 2020 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Kit</a>, saying, "I think not many people know that I have diabetes. It's not visible from the outside, so no one would really know just by looking at you."</p><p>Lila has also been open in the past about people recognizing her because of her mother, telling British Vogue she was shocked that people her age know who her mother is.</p><p>"I went to secondary school and everyone was like, 'Oh, your mum’s Kate Moss!'" she said, recalling to the publication that she would jokingly respond with, "'How do you know who she is? She’s old! She’s old and boring!'"</p><p>"Old and boring" or not, it's clear that Lila has taken quite a few pages out of her mother's playbook.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Lila's father? Meet Jefferson Hack.</h2><p>Given the successes that Lila — who is signed to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kate Moss Agency</a> — has enjoyed in modeling over the last few years, Kate's influence on her life is undeniable. So what about her father, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jefferson Hack</a>? Jefferson is the editorial director, publisher and creative director of Dazed, the media empire that spans print, internet, and visual mediums.</p><p>Kate and Jefferson first met and began dating in 2001 when, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue</a>, Jefferson interviewed the model for Dazed and Confused, which he co-founded. Their relationship quickly got serious, and in September 2002 they became parents to Lila.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Jefferson Hack pictured in 2021 (left) and holding baby Lila in 2003 (right)</p></figure><p>The duo never officially married. In actuality, they began drifting apart romantically not long after Lila was born. Nonetheless, there never appeared to have been bad blood between the former couple. This was epitomized by Jefferson attending Kate's wedding to Jamie Hince in 2011.</p><p>Lila graced the cover of Dazed for its 2018 winter issue.
