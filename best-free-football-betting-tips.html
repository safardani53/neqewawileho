Matjaz Kek's side are flying high in Group H having taken 13 points from a possible 18 after six matches.</p><p>They've lost just one of their last 12 in all competitions - which included solid draws against Denmark and Sweden, and wins over Norway and Romania.</p><p>Their one defeat did come against Finland in Helsinki, but they bossed the statistics in possession, xG and goal attempts. It was just 'one of those nights'.</p><p>They are spearheaded by Europe's next great talent in Benjamin Sesko, who's banged in five in ten matches for RB Leipzig this season, and has two in qualifying already.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">The Sun accumulator</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Our selections</p><ul><li>SLOVENIA vs Finland</li><li><span>Norway vs SPAIN</span></li><li><span>Wales vs CROATIA</span></li></ul><p>This treble is available at 5/1 with Sky Bet and <strong>YOU</strong> can claim it <strong><a aria-label="HERE* (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">HERE*</a></strong></p><p>Fancy £30 in free bets?

One of those Spanish victories came against Sunday's opposition in Malaga when they ran out comprehensive 3-0 winners courtesy of goals from Dani Olmo and Joselu.</p><p>Spain's surprise defeat to Scotland was followed by four-consecutive wins over Italy, Croatia, Georgia and Cyprus, with a colossal 13 scored in their last two outings (6-0, 1-7).</p><p>Norway are in decent enough form and have Erling Haaland at their disposal, but he's blanked in his last four, while the hosts have never beaten Spain in six attempts (L4, D2).</p><h3>Wales vs CROATIA</h3><p>Can we really ignore Croatia at Evens on Sunday?</p><p>Zlatko Dalic's World Cup semi-finalists have lost just once in normal time in their last 19 matches in all competitions, and that was against a Lionel Messi-inspired Argentina in Qatar.</p><p>Nathan Broadhead netted a 93rd-minute equaliser in the reverse fixture in Split, but that was completely against the run of play with Croatia having 63% possession and eight efforts on target to Wales' one.</p><p>Croatia have won four of the seven meetings between these sides, and have never been beaten by Wales in any competition. The Welsh have won two of their last 14 games - but both of those came against lowly Latvia.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">LATEST OFFERS</h2></p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a aria-label="FREE BETS - BEST BETTING OFFERS AND BONUSES NEW CUSTOMERS (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FREE BETS - BEST BETTING OFFERS AND BONUSES NEW CUSTOMERS</a></strong></p><h2 id=remember-to-gamble-responsibly>Remember to gamble responsibly</h2><p><strong>A responsible gambler is someone who:</strong></p><ul><li>Establishes time and monetary limits before playing</li><li>Only gambles with money they can afford to lose</li><li>Never chase their losses</li><li>Doesn’t gamble if they’re upset, angry or depressed</li><li>Gamcare –&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">www.gamcare.org.uk</a></li><li>Gamble Aware –&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">www.begambleaware.org</a></li></ul><p>For help with a gambling problem, call the National Gambling Helpline on 0808 8020 133 or go to www.gamstop.co.uk to be excluded from all UK-regulated gambling websites.</p><p>*New customers only, first single & e/w bet only, 5p minimum stake, 3 x £10 bet tokens.
