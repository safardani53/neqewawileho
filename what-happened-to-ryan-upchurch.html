In the post, he discussed a legal battle against comedian <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole Arbour</a>, who filed a lawsuit demanding credit for several of his songs.</p><p>"Remember when that fake comedian lady Nicole Harbour dragged me through the mud and tried to sue me and got Vera White from Tennessee Voices of Victims to slander me and defame me and all that s--t," Ryan said in a recent YouTube video. "Oh man, Nashville News helped her out, using my name and my face saying 'yeah man we agree, he's so horrible for what he did to that person.' Well guess what, I win motherf--ker."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Ryan Upchurch?</h2><p>Following that video, many naturally wanted more details on what had happened to Ryan and why he was battling with Nicole over credit. The two used to be friendly, but a feud apparently started after Nicole refused to return a wallet that Ryan had left at her house. He eventually called the police to have the wallet returned, and she responded by accusing Ryan of harassment and even filing a lawsuit that she eventually pulled out of.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Nicole claimed that she deserved credit for some of his songs, but a court ruling recently sided with Ryan.</p><p>She also claimed that Ryan's friends <a href=#>Bunny Xo</a> and her husband <a href=#>Jelly Roll</a> had been harassing her.</p><p>"When the narcissist wants to hurt a target they dispatch their henchmen (aka flying monkeys) to do their bidding," she said earlier this year. "This often includes abusive behavior such as creating and spreading lies, twisting the truth, gaslighting, assaults, threats, and violence."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Although the drama around Ryan and Nicole seems far from over, Ryan has certainly run this battle in their ongoing allegations against one another.</p><p>Ryan has always vehemently denied the allegations made against him, and many are skeptical that Nicole's allegations should be taken seriously.</p><p>It's unclear who to believe, especially about the harassment claims, but a judge has ruled pretty clearly on the claims that Nicole deserves credit for some of Ryan's music. The relationship between them is undoubtedly still messy, but on the issue of songwriting credit, Ryan has earned a pretty decisive victory.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSrsZGjera8wqGsq5uY</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
