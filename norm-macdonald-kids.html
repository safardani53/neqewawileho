He passed away on Sept. 14, 2021.</p><p>“He never wanted the diagnosis to affect the way the audience or any of his loved ones saw him," said Norm's producing partner and friend Lori Jo Hoekstra. "Norm was a pure comic. He once wrote that ‘a joke should catch someone by surprise, it should never pander.’ He certainly never pandered. Norm will be missed terribly.”</p><p>Although Norm was battling this illness, he was still working. He was even scheduled to appear at the New York Comedy Festival lineup in November 2021. Now that he has passed, who will carry on his legacy? Does he have any kids? Here's what we know.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who are Norm Macdonald's kids?

Dylan appears to live his life outside of the public eye.</p><p>A clip from an undated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview Norm had with Tom Green</a> features two young men introduced as Norm's "twins" — both named Dylan — though it seems this was likely for a comedy bit.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>During that interview, the young men were brought up from the audience and referred to by someone off-camera as Norm's twin sons. It definitely seems like they're all just playing around, and there doesn't seem to be any information out there about Norm's having another son.</p><p>After all, when David Letterman appeared on Norm's 2018 Netflix talk show Norm Macdonald Has a Show, Norm referred to one child — his son Dylan — in a conversation about his past custody arrangements. Dave asked him, "Did you worry that this was an impediment to [your son's] development?" Norm joked, "A little bit .... but I used his pain as coal for my furnace of ambition."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Norm Macdonald's ex-wife?</h2><p>Although Norm wasn't married at the time of his death, he was at one time.
