And abusers want to keep their victims downtrodden.</p><p>But in addition to blowing up at Michael and accusing him of not loving her, of cheating on her, and of scamming her, Angela said something else.</p><p>She shot down his dreams of being a paid Instagram influencer … claiming that he is simply too boring.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>On Sunday’s episode of 90 Day Fiance: Happily Ever After?, Angela Deem stormed away from Michael Ilesanmi in anger.</p><p>As always, Angela lit a cigarette while seemingly trembling with fury.</p><p>Why? Because Michael has an Instagram account and won’t delete it, even when she screams and trashes his car.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Michael could have sighed with relief at dodging a bullet. Instead, he pursued his furious wife.</p><p>He tried to reassure her that he loves her.</p><p>Unfortunately, Angela’s default state seems to be “inconsolable,” even when she has worked herself up over nothing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Angela’s reply to Michael’s attempt to reassure her is to yell at him, cigarette in hand, that she does not really know that.</p><p>It seems that Michael’s refusal to immediate obey her demands and grovel before her is evidence that he doesn’t love her.</p><p>She thinks that he is cheating and “scamming” her. But Michael is eventually able to get her to sit down and listen for a moment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Michael sits down to talk with her about his Instagram. She seldom lets him speak much during her angry calls.</p><p>Michael explains to her that he needs to have an actual income. And Angela has forbidden him from having a normal job.</p><p>Through his reality TV fame, Michael could become a paid Instagram influencer. Right now, he is building an audience to make himself appealing to advertisers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Meanwhile, Angela seemingly wishes for him to remain a “kept man” until the visa arrives.</p><p>This means keeping him entirely dependent upon the money that she sends — or withholds.</p><p>But Angela insists that, despite Michael’s motives for wanting to capitalize off of his fame, this is not really about money.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Angela has a tendency to explode with rage and anger. This dispute was no exception.</p><p>Many viewers jumped when she abruptly kicked the table in fury.</p><p>“I don’t give a goddamn about no money, bitch” she shouted at Michael.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“F–k you and your goddamn money, bitch,” Angela screeched, looming above Michael while yelling.</p><p>We all struggle to watch this abuse. Angela sometimes have moment that some could perceive as “funny.”</p><p>Watching her terrorize and wear down her fiance, and now husband, is agonizing. It’s not entertainment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Michael assures her that he is not flirting, as she seems to believe that he must be, despite having an Instagram.</p><p>Why, he wonders, can she not trust him?</p><p>Angela screams that he is “untrustable,” which presumably means “untrustworthy.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>And then Angela tells the camera that she doesn’t see the point. She insults her husband.</p><p>“Really, how much money is he gonna make?” she asks.</p><p>“You’ve hot to be, I don’t know how to say this without being rude, but interesting,” Angela says. “He doesn’t have charisma.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Of course, Michael brought up Angela’s obvious hypocrisy, citing something that many viewers have mentioned.</p><p>Angela has been flirting with and duetting with a man on Canada. She called him “sexy” and even discussed visiting him.</p><p>Naturally, Angela’s response was to reveal that she only flirted to make Michael jealous. Then she brought up a new topic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“Your visa is about here,” Angela told him in a taunting tone.</p><p>This was not a reveal intended to encourage her husband. It was, she suggested, a threat.</p><p>She claimed that her attorney had advised her to cancel the visa and divorce him. Unless he deletes his Instagram. Is that what her lawyer really said?</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2Z9cK3NoJylmV2Zsqa5jKamnKOjYrqqr8eanKVlmaGytK3NpqCsZZmjs63BxKeanqpdmb%2BmrcysZKGdo2LBsLuMm6aroZ6cfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
