Most people in Eight Mile Rock rolled their eyes and told Hield his dream was unrealistic.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Teenage boys who were fortunate enough to graduate were expected to work as construction workers, welders, or auto mechanics, all of which were promoted in the local high schools.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>They rarely went to college, and becoming a professional athlete was almost unheard of. In fact, only two players with Bahamian ancestors have had significant NBA careers (Mychal Thompson and Rick Fox).</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Buddy, on the other hand, was unconcerned by any of this. Indeed just a decade later, he was in the NBA league, fulfilling his dreams.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Amateur Career</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Hield demonstrated his early potential by leading his Jack Hayward High School basketball team to the Providence Holiday Tournament championship on a buzzer-beater.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Moreover, he also led his team to the Grand Bahamas High School Championships. Hield was named an All Bahamian Brand All Bahamian Selection for his achievements.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Hield was recruited to join Sunrise Christian Academy in Bel Aire, a basketball prep school in a Wichita, Kansas suburb, after his performances in The Bahamas.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Kyle Lindsted, a current Wichita State assistant and former Sunrise coach, recruited the 6-foot-4 (1.93 m) guard.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>During his junior year at Sunrise Christian, Hield carried the team to the National Association of Christian Athletes national championship, earning MVP honors.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He averaged 22.7 points on.491 shooting in 21.0 minutes per game as a senior in 2011-2012. He received a lot of attention and chose the Oklahoma Sooners over the Kansas Jayhawks.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>College Career</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>As a freshman at Oklahoma, Hield averaged 7.8 points per game and was named the team’s Most Inspirational Player.

He possesses the physicality to be a formidable on- and off-ball defender.</span></p><p>Moreover, he weighs 100 kg. <span data-preserver-spaces=true>He eats chicken, fish, turkey, and salads as part of his diet. His breakfast is also substantial, with a high concentration of carbohydrates and proteins.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Buddy also likes to nap twice a day after heavy meals and workouts.

Off the court, he’s a tireless worker who has shown the ability to play long stretches at small forward.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Hield set a new personal high in his fifth NBA season, averaging 10.2 3-point attempts per game. Those attempts were third-most in the league, trailing only <a href=#>Stephen Curry</a> and <a href=#>Damian Lillard</a>.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He shoots 39.6 percent when he’s just cruising the perimeter, looking for catch-and-shoot opportunities.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>When he dribbles once, Buddy shoots 38.7 percent, and when he dribbles twice, he shoots 48.9 percent. If you take more than two dribbles, your percentages will plummet.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Hield has made it clear that he wants to be more than just a catch-and-shoot wing complementing a rising star in <a href=#>De’Aaron Fox</a>.</span></p><p>Don’t miss out; <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>David Andersen: Career, Net Worth & More>></a></strong></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Buddy Hield: Family</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Hield was brought up in Eight Mile Rock, a coastal region west of Freeport in the Bahamas’ West Grand Bahama District. He was the fifth of his mother, Jackie Braynen’s seven children.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Hield was 11 years old when Jackie divorced his father, Vincent, and the family moved into her mother’s house.

Money was tight even with Jackie working three jobs.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Throughout it all, the family remained close and tight-knit. There were prayers (and sometimes a Bible study) every morning before breakfast, and chores and homework came before television.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>If Jackie needed to spank her son from time to time to keep him in line, so be it. She was mostly known for her gentle nature.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Buddy recalls his mother telling her children to scoot over to the backseat of her van so she could offer rides to strangers walking in the sweltering summer heat.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>And Jackie enjoyed cooking for the neighborhood kids on nights when they might not have eaten otherwise.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Who Is Buddy Hield’s Girlfriend?</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>For many years, the NBA star has been in a serious relationship with his girlfriend, Remi Martinii.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Remi is a fitness freak and a law school graduate, according to her Instagram handle.
