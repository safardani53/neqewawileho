Woody Allen keeps making movies to critical acclaim. Chris Brown is still selling music. Johnny Depp is starring in the new Harry Potter movies.</p><p>But as much as those men are despised by many people, they weren’t exposed during the #MeToo movement. Matt Lauer was. Many hope that this will make the difference, and that he’ll never be able to claw his way back into social acceptance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/matt-lauer-looks-dour-657x1024.jpg><p>Contrary to what the reviled former NBC host might like to believe, <a href=#>Today is doing just fine without Matt Lauer</a>.</p><p>In fact, ratings are higher than they’ve been in 5 years.</p><p>It’s possible that, one day, people will wax nostalgic about how awkwardly charming they found Lauer when he covered the Olympics and will be willing to forget what he was doing to his colleagues when the cameras weren’t running.</p><p>At the moment, however, many people familiar with the allegations against him don’t even want to look at him.</p><p>Annette Roque and her children are better off without having to share their home with him.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Matt Lauer: A Timeline of Terrible Behavior</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2WBcLnAratmpJGqsrN5xaKlmqScrnqwwdKtnJ1llqe8rnnHqKSeZZKueqK6zZ6rrZ1dp7yywcRo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
