And one of Ceaser’s skeletons fell out of his closet, which caused VH1 to sever ties with him.</p><p>On June 22, 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a video</a> of Ceaser abusing his dog made its rounds on social media. In the video, Ceaser is seen hitting the animal with a folded chair and kicking him. As expected, this left a bad taste in many people’s mouths.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Aside from Ceaser being read for filth online, VH1 quickly stepped in to deliver the final crushing blow: Ceaser’s pink slip. "We have made the decision to cut ties with Ceaser Emanuel from Black Ink Crew New York,” a VH1 rep told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> at the time. “Since next season was close to finishing production, this decision will not impact the upcoming season."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Ceaser eventually revealed his side of the story. On June 25, 2022, Ceaser spoke with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> about the unfortunate incident and shared that he simply was "breaking up a fight" between his dogs and one of the animals turned on him. However, Ceaser was deeply apologetic for his actions and realized that the video "looked crazy."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“Even me looking at it, it looks crazy. But it’s a moment in time I wish I could take back," Ceaser told the outlet. "I came home, my dogs is attacking each other. And I don’t mean the regular, just play fighting. I mean they was going for each other’s necks, basically trying to kill each other.”</p><p>Ceaser explained that he had no intention of abusing the dogs, but rather he was only trying to deescalate the situation by "opening the garage door."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Interestingly, Ceaser shared that the timing of the video release is questionable, which he feels proves his belief that he was set up.</p><p>“I don’t know how the footage got leaked,” Ceaser said. “I know that was off my Ring camera … I’ma keep it a buck with you. I feel like I’m being set up in some way because the way I’m being portrayed, that’s not my character.”</p><p>In a June 27, 2022, interview with On tha Radar's Kiotti Brown, Ceaser said that he thinks his <a href=#>ex-girlfriend, Suzette Samuel</a>, was responsible for leaking the video.</p><p>Ceaser claimed that since he ended the relationship with Suzette, she retaliated by releasing the video. Ceaser also said that the video is old, without giving an exact timeline for when the incident occurred.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>However, Ceaser's daughter Cheyenne also spoke her piece about the situation at the time.
