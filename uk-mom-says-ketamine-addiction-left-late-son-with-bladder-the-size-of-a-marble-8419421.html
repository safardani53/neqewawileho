She said he used ketamine so frequently that his bladder shrank to “the size of a marble,” according to an interview with the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Times of London</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“His use initially started at festivals like many youngsters do, after the death of his best friend and then being on furlough from the Covid 19 pandemic his use [escalated] and he delved deep into addiction that he could not get out of” Rogers wrote on her <a href=# class=pseudoStyle data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Change.org petition</a>, where she’s hoping to have the drug reclassified as a Class A drug, a more severe category that carries stronger penalties for possession and distribution.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“His mental health deteriorated, his bladder suffered, he was passing blood and chunks of his bladder lining, he was suffering excruciating K cramps and then the vicious cycle commences, taking the ketamine which has [anesthetic] properties to deal with the pain,” she continued on the petition.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Rian Rogers dreamed of being a software engineer.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Rian Rogers/Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As Rogers pointed out, ketamine is popular at music festivals and raves, where it’s often seen as a harmless drug. As the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>National Institute of Health</a> reported in 2002, “This drug seems to be abused, mainly by the intranasal route, owing to its hallucinogen effects. Its used in ‘rave-party’ appears to be marked by unsuspected consumption.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Commonly dismissed as “horse tranquilizer,” ketamine’s “predominant legitimate use is as a veterinary anesthetic,” the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>U.S. Department of Justice</a> points out. But it’s often used illegally and recreationally because it’s also a hallucinogenic that can make people feel “calm and relaxed,” the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency</a> says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The drug was named as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the cause of death</a> for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Friends</a> star <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Matthew Perry</a>, who was practicing ketamine infusion therapy. His last treatment took place just "one and a half weeks before" his death, the coroner’s report stated. However, the report noted that "the ketamine in his system at death could not be from that infusion therapy, since ketamine's half-life is 3 to 4 hours, or less."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ketamine’s impacts on the bladder, however, are less publicized. It causes a condition the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>National Institute of Health</a> describes as "ketamine-induced cystitis (KIC)."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Common KIC-related problems are urinary pain and discomfort, bladder epithelial barrier damage, reduced bladder storage and increased pressure, ureter stenosis, and kidney failure, all of which significantly impact patients’ quality of life.," the NIH says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Furthermore, it becomes a vicious cycle when KIC patients attempt to manage their urinary pain with increased ketamine use," which is what Clare said happened to Rian.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</a>&nbsp;to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“He was in a lot of pain over the last three years due to his bladder issues and would regularly take tramadol, ibuprofen, paracetamol et cetera but none could give him good relief to sleep,” his mother told the Times. “His bladder had shrunk to the size of a marble. It was really ulcerated. His ketamine use was because of the pain and addiction.”&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Rian Rogers poses in a selfie.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Rian Rogers/Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rian’s family sent him to a private addiction and rehabilitation clinic. But three weeks after coming out, he relapsed. Once back at school, his bladder symptoms had gotten so bad he was moved to a room with a private bathroom.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And she told the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>UK Sun</a>, Rian’s bladder capacity had shrunk from 500ml to just 90ml. He was on the waiting list for bladder surgery when he died.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“This drug is a killer,” Clare told the Times. “It is taking bladders from young children.
