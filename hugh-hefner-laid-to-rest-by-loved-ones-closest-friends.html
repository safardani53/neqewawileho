You’d expect a celebrity funeral to be, at the very least, the size of a normal funeral.
That would mean dozens to hundreds of attendees."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He was known for wearing his signature red robe. He&nbsp;</p><p>So it’s a little surprising to hear that his funeral was uncharacteristically low-key.</p><p>TMZ reports that <a href=#>Hugh Hefner’s funeral</a> was on Saturday, at noon, in&nbsp;L.A.’s Westwood Village Memorial Park.</p><p>Hef’s four children, his wife Crystal Harris (who <a href=#>inherits none of his fortune</a>), and some key Playboy staffers were in attendance. That was it.</p><p>It was a small, private ceremony. Nice, but downplayed.</p><p>Hef’s body was interred beside Marilyn Monroe’s, in a plot that he bought very deliberately in 1992 for $75,000.</p><p>And we have to talk about the fact that his body is resting beside Marilyn Monroe’s, even if it necessitates speaking ill of the dead.</p><p>Because … in no way is this not creepy.</p><p>When Hef launched Playboy, he obtained old photographs of Marilyn Monroe from before she was rich and famous.</p><p>As a teen, she had taken photos to obtain some much-needed cash. Hef bought the photos and the rights to distribute them and used them for his new business.</p><p>Marilyn, at the time, was terrified that it would ruin her career.&nbsp;</p><p>Many people have called out that Hef’s desire to be laid to rest beside her is creepy to the max and even a sort of violation.</p><p>(Even though, you know, they’re not alive anymore … the creepiness of it all still lingers)</p><p>That’s hardly the only thing about Hugh Hefner’s history that makes people uncomfortable.</p><p>As <a href=#>revealed by Holly Madison</a>, not everything was necessarily as it seemed within the Playboy Mansion itself.</p><p>Reportedly, Hugh Hefner offered drugs to his girlfriends to make them more open to sex.</p><p>He also allegedly fostered a competitive environment in which the women competed with each other for his favor.</p><p>Furthermore, Holly says that Hugh would routinely reduce his girlfriends to tears, talking down to them, which sounds like emotional abuse and a pretty standard tactic used by people who want to keep others dependent on their praise and affection.</p><p><a href=#>Kendra Wilkinson praises Hef’s name</a> to this day and refutes Holly Madison’s version of their time at the mansion.</p><p>But it’s not uncommon at all for two people in what seems like the same position (that’s not a sex joke) to have very, very different experiences.</p><p>Other criticisms of Hugh Hefner include that he historically presented himself as a supporter of women’s rights, gay rights, and rights for people of color while all the time building a business that profited from images of blonde white women that catered to men.</p><p>He would neither be the first nor the last figure to receive acclaim for being progressive while seeming to do more to use and profit from women than actually help them.</p><p>(<a href=#>Joss Whedon</a>, anyone?)</p><p>Of course, those who have compared Hugh Hefner to the likes of Woody Allen or Bill Cosby … need to chill the f–k out and are definitely in need of a reality check.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Hugh Hefner Dead at 91: Celebrities React</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2Z9cLTUoJ9moJWbu6a%2BjKWYopxdqbxuvsSsq2aaqWK5sMLEnWSoppWoeqS4zqycrKxdm7%2Bqsc2dqmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
