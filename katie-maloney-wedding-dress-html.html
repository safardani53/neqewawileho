However, the couple did not break the news of their engagement until a month later.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>On July 7, 2015, the reality star announced via her Instagram that she'd said yes! Of course, they had to delay the announcement until the episode was televised.&nbsp;</p><p>As for the engagement ring, Schwartz went with a&nbsp;2 carat rose cut pear shape champagne diamond in 14 karats of rose gold with a&nbsp;little pink sapphire to represent.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Katie Maloney Found the Perfect Wedding Dress</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The wedding was held in August 2016, but for obvious reasons, the public wasn't informed of the deets till February 2017. Anyways, the ceremony was held in a breathtakingly beautiful forest venue in Northern California.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The bride was clad in a stunning&nbsp;Zuhair Murad long-sleeve lace wedding dress from Kleinfeld Bridal store in New York City, the home of Say Yes to the Dress. She picked it out the minute she put it on! She told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">People Style</a>,&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The minute I put it on there were goosebumps all over. I thought, ‘This is it. This is the dress I’m going to marry Tom in.’ You just know. I had such a visceral reaction it was awesome.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>Second Time Wedding Dress and Sort of Engagement Ring</h2><p>While it is no engagement ring, Schwartz gifted his two-time wife a massive stone for their second wedding. According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sources with Page Six</a>, the ring was a 15-carat heart-shaped tanzanite ring designed by their favorite jeweler, Kyle Chan.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>As per the jeweler, the ring would easily retail for $35,000 for the stone alone. Still, what made&nbsp;the ring all the more special was the fact that Schwartz found the gem on his own. Chan told the outlet,&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Schwartz went with me to my yearly gem hunting in the desert last year. And he picked out this beautiful supersize tanzanite for Katie. Schwartz did well. He went all out to find her the heart from the ocean.</p><p>All the while, Maloney met her husband's love with a&nbsp;1-carat emerald-cut diamond with a solid heavy rose gold band worth $20,000, according to Chan.</p><p>Finally, the couple decided against having a formal&nbsp;wedding dress for their second time down the aisle. Instead, they went with a Western-themed ceremony in Sin City.</p><p>The groom went full Elvis with his cowboy outfit, while the wifey went with a simple yet elegant slit bodycon. The bride flaunted her second-time wedding dress over an Instagram post where she thanked the show and the venue for spoiling them with a second wedding, complete with a '#youonlygetmarriedtwice.' <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKORqbamecyao6imla56uLHDnaCnn12Zv6a%2F0mefraWc</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
