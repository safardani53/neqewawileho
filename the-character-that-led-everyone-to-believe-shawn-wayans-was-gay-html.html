Though his character wasn't specified as a gay person, many believed that he was a closeted man.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In one instance, during a locker room scene,&nbsp;Ray chose to look gay. When changing his shirt, he asked his friend if the yellow vest he was wearing made him look gay. But, when his friend answered no, he twisted the bottom of his vest, inside and over, to highlight his chest and asked him if doing that did it.</p><p>In another scene, he&nbsp;asked his girlfriend Brenda to wear a man's clothing before getting physical.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>As if that wasn’t indicative enough, Ray was also&nbsp;supportive of one of his male friends. He brought him flowers, ran his bathwater, and even slept by his friend's side during restless nights. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In a nutshell, the movie showcased Ray as a guy who insisted on being straight but acted like a gay person.&nbsp;And, due to such portrayal, many believed Wayans was also gay.</p><h2>Shawn Has Three Kids With His Baby Mama, Ursula Alberto</h2><p>One fact that dispels Wayans's gay rumors is his long-term relationship. He was with Ursula Alberto, a fitness guru. Though they never married, they remained together&nbsp;from 1999 to 2008.</p><p>From their relationship, they have three children. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The first kid from their relationship,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Laila</a>, was born in 1999. Then the second child, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ilia</a>, in 2002, and finally, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Marlon Wayans</a> in 2004. The duo separated four years after the birth of their last child.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Since the split from his baby mama, the Little Man actor&nbsp;hasn't been in a relationship publicly.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2><span>Shawn </span>Wayans Is Not Gay, Claims Brother</h2><p>Wayans's performance in the film, Scary Movie&nbsp;made people suggest that the actor was indeed gay. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>But, it was not only him who was dragged in the swirl of rumors. His younger brother, an actor of the Scary Movie franchise, Marlon Wayans, was also speculated to be gay. The stories came after Marlon was spotted&nbsp;leaving a club with a transgender person&nbsp;in 2010. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Marlon addressed the query of his and his brother's&nbsp;orientation by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">taking it to his Twitter</a>.</p><p>He denied the rumors and insisted that he and his brother were straight.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Moreover, the actor&nbsp;revealed his relationship status and dispelled the gay rumors in 2015 once again.</p><p>During an interview with the RJs Fernando and Greg, the gay hosts of Radio 99.7, Shawn&nbsp;shared that he was dating a nurse.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>When the hosts asked if he was the one who always had to pay on&nbsp;the dates, he revealed that his girlfriend treated him at times because&nbsp;she was doing alright in her career.</p><p>However, that was the furthest he talked about his relationship. But&nbsp;we can probably put the Shawn Wayans gay rumors to rest for now. Without concrete confirmation, mere&nbsp;speculations on someone's orientation is generally frowned upon.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Where is Shawn Wayans Now?</h2><p>As of August 2021, Wayans is out touring. He took to Instagram to announce his Shawn Wayans Comedy Tour dates and locations, back in January.&nbsp;</p><p>His last scheduled performance is&nbsp;on August 8, 2021,&nbsp;at the San Jose Improv, San Jose, California.</p><p>He announced his comedy tour after the restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic were eased upon in the USA.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>By his caption, it seems like the comedian was ready to get the tour ball rolling again. He urged fans to come out and get their laugh on.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6m1pnnCoZirmZOpsrN506GYrWWcmrFusdWeqbKnnpp6tbuMm5yloZWrsm6%2Fx5qup2WnlsaiutJmrpqrXZyuunrHraSl</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
