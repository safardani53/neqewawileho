Outside of the show, he’s most successful for his business FUBU, which is an apparel company that specializes in hip-hop-inspired apparel.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Besides his successful businesses, Daymond is also a very successful husband and dad. The CEO has been married to his wife&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Heather Taras</a>&nbsp;</strong>since 2018, and they have a very happy relationship. Heather revealed that the pair had been dating since 2006 in a 2020 interview with<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;</a><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Contemporary Approach</a>, and they’re still going strong to this day.&nbsp;Find out everything you need to know about Heather and their relationship here.</p><h2>Daymond Proposed on the ‘Shark Tank’ Set</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/daymond-john-wife-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Shark Tank&nbsp;actually played a very big role in Daymond and Heather’s wedding. While details about their first meeting and early romance are seemingly kept private, the FUBU president revealed that he popped the question on the set of his hit show in 2016. He revealed he was worried, because Heather knew his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>fellow</a> <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sharks</a>. “I was nervous. I was proposing on set,” he told&nbsp;<strong>Harry Connick Jr.&nbsp;</strong>in a 2017 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>interview</a>. “I saw&nbsp;<strong>Kevin [O’Leary]&nbsp;</strong>in the corner, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>whispering to her about royalties</a> and all kinds of stuff when I proposed, but she said yes, and I’m very happy about that.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The pair got married in 2018 in Hollis, Queens. When they celebrated their fifth wedding anniversary, Daymond shared <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photos</a> from that special day, including that their daughter <strong>Minka Jagger&nbsp;</strong>attended. He praised Heather for sticking by him all these years, especially after&nbsp;Shark Tank’s&nbsp;success. “Heather showed her true colors and had my back. She shared me with the rest of the world and endured the public criticisms. She advised me during the dark times. And would never waiver in her dedication,” he wrote in the post.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Besides the Queens ceremony, Heather also revealed that they had another intimate ceremony for family and friends in Santorini, Greece in a New Year’s Eve post on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> in 2018. “What an exceptional year becoming Mrs. John,” she wrote.</p><h2>Daymond Was Married Before Meeting Heather</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>While he’s been in a longtime relationship with Heather, she’s not his first wife. Daymond was married before FUBU was a success, and he said that his dedication to the work was part of the reason that his first marriage ended. “I was so concentrated on work. Many of us who live with our families don’t see our families,” he told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CNBC</a>&nbsp;in a 2016 interview.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Daymond explained that his wife “saw me on TV more than she saw me in person,” and he said she eventually told him that he wasn’t “the person I fell in love with” anymore. “She took everything. And it wasn’t one red cent. She took her love and my two little girls away from me. I wouldn’t be there anymore on Christmas to watch my girls open up their presents,” he said.</p><h2>Daymond and Heather Have a Daughter</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>As mentioned above, Daymond and Heather are proud parents to a daughter. Heather gave birth to Minka in 2016, and she often shares adorable photos of her daughter on Instagram. Besides Minka, Daymond is also a dad to&nbsp;<strong>Yasmeen&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Destiny&nbsp;</strong>from his first marriage. Like his first wife, his daughters are very private, but he occasionally shares <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photos</a> of them on social media, like when he wrote about how proud he was of all their accomplishments in May 2023.</p><h2>Heather Is Very Into Health</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Heather’s Instagram bio boasts that she’s “gluten-free” and has a “healthy lifestyle.” She’s revealed her interests in <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tennis</a>, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>celery juicing</a>, and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>swimming</a> on her social media. She also detailed homeopathic treatments she takes in the above-mentioned interview with&nbsp;Contemporary Approach.&nbsp;“Weekly, I get a general Vitamin C IV drip with several homeopathics, a glutathione drip, and often I do Ozone with the UVB machine. For me, it makes the difference between having energy and being depleted for the week due to autoimmune struggles I deal with,” she said.</p><h2>She Loves Family Halloween Costumes</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>Who doesn’t love getting dressed up for Halloween? It’s always more fun when coordinating with a group, and Heather is no exception. For the scary holiday every year, she shares her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>costumes</a>, and she often coordinates with Daymond or her daughter or both. She and Minka <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>dressed as Darth Vader</a> together in 2022. The girls went as <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Super-Girl</a> in 2021. That same year, she also dressed as <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Cruella de Vil,</a> and Daymond went as Bane from&nbsp;The Dark Knight Rises,&nbsp;although her costume did have a bit of a Harley Quinn feel. In 2020, she and Daymond went for a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>gothic look,</a> while she also matched with Minka in fun unicorn costumes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8OasKannpl6q7vHp6pmr5mbsm6x1Z6psqyYnruoedOoZKSmn6x6oq7OrqtmoJWWwamx0WarmqqRqHp2fZZqcHFpXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
