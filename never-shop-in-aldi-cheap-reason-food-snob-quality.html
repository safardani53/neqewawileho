Not only is she not impressed with the fruit and vegetables, which she claims go off before you even get home, but she also expressed that her food-snob kids can tell that the quality isn’t great.
Opening up on social media, savvy mum Sinead Baldev explained that she also isn’t a fan of the checkouts in Aldi, as she thinks you have to be a ‘professional packer’ to shop there’."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Aldi is not the <a href=#>cheapest</a> supermarket.</p><p>“It gives me <a href=#>anxiety</a>. I just can’t deal with the <a href=#>supermarket</a>.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more shopping stories">Read more shopping stories</h2><p>When it comes to the fresh produce, Sinead expressed: “Firstly I’m going to start off with the fruit and veg - it literally goes off before you’ve even got home.”</p><p>Not only this, but she revealed that she struggles to concentrate due to how busy her local Aldi is, as she added: “It is so busy. There are so many people and everyone is just shooting everywhere. I can’t deal with it.&nbsp;</p><p>“Because I don’t shop there, I don’t know where anything is.</p><p>“I can’t concentrate. It stresses me out.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>In terms of the food quality, Sinead claimed: “When you are buying cheaper food, the quality does drop. And my kids can taste it.</p><p>“Are they food-snobs? Yes.</p><p>“Don’t get me wrong, there is some stuff from <a href=#>Lidl</a> that they do like and I’ll buy them.&nbsp;</p><p>“But a lot of foods, the snobs like branded.</p><p>“I have to go up and down every single aisle because I don’t know where nowt is.”</p><p>Discussing the checkouts, Sinead continued: “Then we have the whole checkout experience.&nbsp;</p><p>“They throw your shopping at you. Your shopping is getting thrown at you. It’s a lot.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’ve told them to slow down so many times.</p><p>“Now when you go to Lidl, I know the checkout system is exactly the same, but in my local Lidl, it’s quiet, it’s dead.</p><p>“There’s hardly anybody in there and when you do get to the checkout, they are so slow. They take their time and you’ve got more space on that checkout than you do in Aldi.</p><p>“You have to be a professional packer to shop at Aldi.</p><p>“My local Aldi also do not do click and collect. You have to go in the supermarket.&nbsp;</p><p>“So, all in all, I just don’t like it.”</p><p>The <a href=#>TikTok</a> clip, which was posted under the username @<a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">sineadbaldev</a>, has clearly left many stunned, as it has quickly amassed a whopping 17,300 likes.</p><p>Many social media users agreed with Sinead and were eager to express this in the comments.&nbsp;</p><p>One person said: “I’m the same, I think the food quality is poor.”</p><p>Another added: “That’s the reason I can’t shop there as they scan so fast and I can’t deal with it, it’s madness.”&nbsp;</p><p>A third commented: “Exactly the same! It's always mental in the meat section. No time to look at anything properly as you feel you're in the way of everyone else.”&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, many other shoppers took to the comments to share which supermarket they prefer to shop in.</p><p>One bargain hunter wrote: “This is why I love <a href=#>Tesco</a>. Because you can use a device to scan everything yourself, pack it yourself when walking around and just pay at the end.”&nbsp;</p><p>A second penned: “M&S is way cheaper than Aldi on some items [and] the shopping experience is much better.”</p><p>Whilst someone else claimed: “My sons a food snob too haha he’s additional needs and can tell when it’s a cheaper version etc so we tend to shop at <a href=#>Asda</a>.”</p><p>An Aldi spokesperson said:&nbsp;“Which? named Aldi the Cheapest Supermarket for November 2023 and our promise to shoppers is that we will always provide the lowest grocery prices in Britain.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"Value is the number one consideration for most households and as the lowest-priced supermarket in Britain our customers will always pay less for their shop with Aldi.”</p><p><strong>Fabulous will pay for your exclusive stories.
