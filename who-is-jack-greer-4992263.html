Jack Greer Is An Artist</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>When Jack isn’t busy getting into lip locks with stunning models, he is busy creating art. The 35-year-old is an artist who created many unique works which he shares <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>via Instagram</a>. The self-described “prolific innovator” works with various mediums including “drawing, photography, sculpture, and apparel design,” per his <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>website</a>. Jack has also used photos in collages that include sculptures, installations, and more. “In 2012, he created a series of sculptures consisting of chainsaws embedded in transparent blocks of resin. Greer is also an active member of The Still House Group, an organization founded by <strong>Isaac Brest</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Alex Perweiler</strong>,” per the site.</p><h2>2. He Was Spotted Kissing Emily Ratajkowski</h2><a title=@emrata href=# rel=nofollow>@emrata</a><p id=content-paragraph-6><a title="♬ original sound - HBO" href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>♬ original sound – HBO</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The talented man was spotted kissing Emrata on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a date</a> in New York City on Dec. 21, 2022 (see <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photos HERE</a>). Although the duo did not hold hands, they made sure to give each other a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>big smooch</a> while on their adorable night out in the Big Apple. The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>mom-of-one</a> rocked a red <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>puffer jacket</a>, while Jack looked cozy in a black puffer coat. Despite their date, Emily has made it clear she is dating <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>multiple people</a> following her Sept. 2022 divorce. One of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her suitors</a> includes&nbsp;Saturday Night Live&nbsp;alum&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Pete Davidson</strong></a>, 29, who was previously in a relationship with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>.</p><h2>3. Jack Lives In New York City</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>His budding romance with Emrata is convenient, as both of them live in New York City. His art and business are based out of the bustling city where the&nbsp;My Body&nbsp;author works as well. On the Dec. 22, 2022, episode of her podcast,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>High Low</a>, Em opened up about downloading <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a dating app</a>. “I was like, ‘f**k it,’” she declared. “I was feeling defiant because so many people told me not to get [the dating app].” The&nbsp;Gone Girl&nbsp;actress has also been linked to&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>DJ Orazio Rispo</strong></a>.</p><h2>4. He Runs A Business</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>As previously mentioned, Jack is an artist but also a business owner. His company, Iggy NYC, creates a plethora of clothing items. Jack’s works are so successful that one of <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>his sweaters</a> was featured on an episode of the hit HBO series <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Euphoria</a>. He took to Instagram to gush about the moment he saw&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Hunter Schafer</a>&nbsp;</strong>rocking his brand. “Jules from the show Euphoria wearing the Streetwise knit sweater. Couldn’t be more stoked on this surprise. Felt cute might delete,” he captioned the July 2019 post.</p><h2>5. Jack Likes Books</h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>Emrata’s latest man loves not only art, but also books. He has been featured on the NYC bookstore Pillow-Cat Books <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram account</a> various times. Jack even rocked an adorable blue t-shirt with a kitten on it to support the local book shop. “Santa has a new muscular worker (@iggy.nyc) who’s helping us pull the gate up and down in the anniversary tee! *Speaking of gates, starting this week, we have special holiday hours: 10am-8pm! See you soon!!! Also, #taptoshop if you want to be muscular and cute like Jack,” they captioned the Dec. 5, 2022 post. Two days later they posted a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>similar photo</a> of Jack wearing the same shirt. “Jack and @iggy.nyc helping out with their muscles and our bench in the Pillow-Cat Anniversary Tee #pillowcatgoodies #taptoshop #muscles,” they wrote.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K3oq%2FKZp6rnZWnenWFmGtpb2tf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
