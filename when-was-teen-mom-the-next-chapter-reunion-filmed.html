The first season of Teen Mom: The Next Chapter is full of the drama we have come to know, love, and, honestly, expect from the franchise. And the first reunion special for the Teen Mom spinoff is no different. But in order to get a better idea of the timeline, fans want to know when Teen Mom: The Next Chapter's reunion was filmed."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But it also brings up issues between the ladies, as well as <a href=#>Briana and her ex Devoin</a>'s problems. In order to determine where everyone stands now, it's important to look at the filming timeline.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When was the 'Teen Mom: The Next Chapter' reunion filmed?</h2><p>While MTV hasn't revealed an exact date for when the Teen Mom: The Next Chapter reunion was filmed, we have a pretty good idea. During the special, Dr. Drew gives co-host Nessa a gift basket to congratulate her on becoming a mom. She welcomed her first child in August 2022. Nessa also mentions <a href=#>Cheyenne</a> being a newlywed during the special and Cheyenne was married in September 2022.</p><p>And <a href=#>Leah and Jaylan's breakup</a> is also mentioned in the first part of the reunion. Leah publicly acknowledged the breakup in October 2022. Given the holiday season, it would make sense for both parts of the Teen Mom: The Next Chapter reunion to have filmed in October or even early November 2022, which isn't too far off from the December 2022 air dates.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The Season 1 reunion for 'Teen Mom: The Next Chapter' is split into two parts.</h2><p>While the first part of the special doesn't include too much drama between the moms, a promo that aired at the end of the first part promises some animosity from <a href=#>Ashley</a> toward some of the other moms. And drama between them is nothing new.</p><p>We just have to wait until Part 2 to get more of it.

The second installment of <a href=#>Teen Mom: Family Reunion</a> premieres on MTV on Jan. 3 at 8 p.m. EST to slide right into The Next Chapter's former time slot.</p><p>The series focuses on relationships between not only the cast members, but in Season 2, it also brings their own moms along for the ride.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>During a retreat, moms from Teen Mom: The Next Chapter and <a href=#>Teen Mom: Young & Pregnant</a> get together to try and hash out their differences.
