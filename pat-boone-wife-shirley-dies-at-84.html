I've parted with my better half for a little while… but we don't die, we just move on to another place, and today was moving day," Pat said of his high school sweetheart. "She's changed her address is all and moved to a different mansion that I expect to join her in one day."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm very confident of that," Pat added. "That took the sting out of what happened today because we know we're gonna be together again and have a whole new beginning."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Pat and Shirley Boone.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Pat Boone</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pat and Shirley began their love story at 16 years old. "We were very much in love," Pat revealed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It wasn't until they were 19 when Shirley's family planned to move away, that Pat realized it was time to ask her father — country singing legend Red Foley — for permission to marry Shirley.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He tearfully asked me one thing, 'Will you take care of my girl?' and I said I would," Pat explained. "And the tears rolled into his coffee because he knew he was moving and planned to take her with him, but he was willing to leave her with me."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In November 1953, the pair eloped and then settled in Teaneck, New Jersey, where they welcomed their four daughters in five years.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Together, they supported each other, as their lives and careers were established — Pat was working his way through rigorous Columbia University (he graduated cum laude) and battling with Elvis for the hearts of America's teenagers, while Shirley focused on raising their four girls.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Pat and Shirley Boone.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Pat Boone</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They eventually moved to Beverly Hills together, where they resided for more than 50 years, watching their four children, 16 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren grow up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The thing that would most fulfill her was to be a good wife, and mother, and grandmother and to create happy homes," Pat said of his wife, noting that the pair would often take "second or third honeymoons" together on ocean voyages.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to being by her sweetheart's side for more than half a century, Shirley was also a best-selling author, recording artist, television hostess and humanitarian.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Pat and Shirley Boone.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Rebecca Sapp/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shirley was "well-known" for starting a billion-dollar Christian ministry. The couple's Christian faith was also a contributing key factor in what drove their marriage to last for so long.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We didn't have the perfect marriage, but it helps to marry a magnificent woman," Pat tells PEOPLE. "You make your commitments to God and each other, and in troubled times, you hang on to the commitment to God, and to your kids. You see the problems through and you find you're stronger because of it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Part of her passion was also focused on giving back to others, which she first did through an organization she created called Save the Refugee.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: Chicago Couple Married 69 Years Dies Holding Hands: 'They Are Angels Dancing Together,' Says Son</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shirley, along with ministers and other humane organizations, raised over a million dollars in a week's time, sending food and medicines over to Cambodia to assist with the hunger crisis. Their organization eventually morphed into Mercy Corps, now one of the most prominent worldwide hunger relief organizations.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"[Mercy Corps] continues to grow, and all of this started from her tears and her conviction that we could do something," Pat said. "She was always ready to interrupt what she was doing and help somebody else."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And that desire to give back was one of the things Pat says he will remember most about his wife.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She had an honest, deep, earnest love for people and her desire to help people as an activist," he said.
