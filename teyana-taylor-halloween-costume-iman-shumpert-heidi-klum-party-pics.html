The party will be&nbsp;insane, as always, and the music will be by special guest <strong>DJ Questlove</strong> while guests enjoyed signature cocktails by SVEDKA Vodka. Plus, the theme is going to be&nbsp;amazing and the space will be transformed into a mad scientistâ€™s laboratory for the night complete with crazy concoctions around every corner â€” how amazing is that!?</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ SLUG!

Her boobs had cuts and lines all around them and her face looked like a mad plastic surgeon got his hands on it. It was spooky and sexy and creepy all at once! Iman was all cut up too, but with a matching pink hat and shirt and a gold chain. Honestly, we couldnâ€™t help but think of <strong>Desiigner</strong> when we saw him!</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>We love the fact that they get so into this holiday and Teyana has been posting pics of their costumes for days â€” they love Halloween! This is the second couples costume they dressed up as this year. Their first costume was Harley Quinn and the Joker from Suicide Squad and it was seriously amazing because they went all out. They both put white makeup all over their faces and bodies and Iman even rocked a bright green wig â€” it was hilarious!</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>We absolutely adore this couple and the fact that they go above and beyond when it comes to dressing up for Halloween is amazing. What did you guys think of the couplesâ€™ Halloween costumes? Did you love them as much as we did?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlmZH5ye49qZq2dqZa7onnTmrClp6JitaK4y6iunp2eYrCwv9OupJ5lmaKur3nSoaymqJWnwW60xKKbomWbocKuec%2Baqa2xXaW2pL%2BO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
