Law alum has been married three times: to <strong>Laura Johnson</strong> from 1985 to 1989, to <strong>Nicollette Sheridan</strong> from 1991 to 1992, and to his third spouse, <strong>Lisa Rinna</strong>, since 1997.(Hamlin and Rinna, 59, have a 12-year age gap between them.)</p><p>The couple, who share daughters <strong>Delilah Belle Hamlin</strong>, 24, and <strong>Amelia Gray Hamlin</strong>, 21, have been through a lot in their 25 years of marriage — including starring in their own reality show, Harry Loves Lisa, which aired in 2010.</p><p>“I don’t remember anything about shooting Harry Loves Lisa. I never liked the title,” the Broadway actor — who is also father of son <strong>Dimitri Hamlin</strong>, 42, whom he shares with ex <strong>Ursula Andress</strong> — revealed to Us about the short-lived series, which consisted of six episodes.</p><p>Still, the pair have made countless memories over the years, including costarring in the Broadway production of Chicago — “I learned how to sing and twirl a mean baton while playing Billy Flynn,” Harry shared — and going scuba diving in Micronesia. (“I’m dying to go back,” the Golden Globe nominee told Us.)</p><p>While Harry and the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum have been on countless adventures together, the Veronica Mars alum cherishes their Sunday meals at home — which is where the Bolognese recipe comes in.</p><p>“On a typical Sunday afternoon, I’m having a bowl of pasta with my wife in Malibu,” he said.</p><p>Keep scrolling for more little-known facts about Harry, including his Fullbright Scholarship, his “stint in jail” and more.</p><p>1.
