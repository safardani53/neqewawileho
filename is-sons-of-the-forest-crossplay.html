After years of waiting, fans can finally jump into the survival horror game Sons of the Forest when it goes into early access on Feb. 23. As the sequel to 2014's The Forest by Endnight Games, Sons of the Forest more-or-less re-captures the horrifying energy permeating throughout the previous game with new flourishes."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Here's a breakdown of everything you need to know.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is 'Sons of the Forest' crossplay-friendly?</h2><p>Unfortunately, Sons of the Forest will not feature crossplay functionality when it launches into early access, but that may change — depending on what Endnight decides for the game's future.</p><p>As of this writing, Sons of the Forest will release as a Steam early access PC exclusive on Feb. 23, which explains why there's no supported crossplay feature.</p><p>However, it's safe to bet Sons of the Forest may arrive on <a href=#>PlayStation</a> and other platforms later, following a similar schedule as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Forest released on PS4</a> when it officially launched out of its early access period.</p><p>Even so, The Forest still doesn't support crossplay between available platforms, which may be the same fate for Sons of the Forest.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"[Endnight] might implement [crossplay] for [the] launch of consoles, but if they don't get a ton of feedback for adding it, they might not sadly," wrote <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one player</a> on the Sons of the Forest Steam page.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Other fans</a> also believe "the game probably won't even release on consoles" and warns onlookers hoping for crossplay and console release to temper their expectations.

Unfortunately, you won't be able to play co-op locally, so it's best to connect with friends over the internet.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Can 'Sons of the Forest' run on Steam Deck?</h2><p>On the Sons of the Forest <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">store page</a>, there's no confirmation of <a href=#>Steam Deck</a> support for the survival horror game.
