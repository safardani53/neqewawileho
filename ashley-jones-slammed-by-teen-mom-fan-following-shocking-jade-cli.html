That’s the only guess I’ve got," Ashley said.</p><p>Teen Mom 2 viewers are surely familiar with <a href=#>Jade’s mother</a> and her struggles with substance abuse, so they know that comment is a particularly low blow.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>On Reddit and elsewhere, fans went off on Ashley for making such a cold-blooded remark about Jade’s family situation.</p><p>"’She’s on the same drugs as her mother’ but this is who y’all defending ???? Lmfao Ashley is a joke. CLOWN," one user wrote,<a href=#> according to</a> The Sun.</p><p>"Come on Ashley, if you run your mouth don’t expect to not have people b-tch at you," another advised.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"Then you go and say you think they are on drugs? No they are just sick of highschool b-tches…"</p><p>"It don’t sit right with me how Ashley’s GO TO shade is always about drug abuse, aka mental illness. Ehh," a third person chimed in.</p><p>"I love Ashley but we don’t make fun of or poke fun at people with drug addiction," a fourth observed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"I know she was still pissed from the night before but that part wasn’t cool."</p><p>For her part, Jade has also been taking a good deal of flak on social media, as at least one viewer is convinced that she’s already "ruined" the new Teen Mom spinoff series.</p><p>“Who’s excited for the new episode of Teen Mom Family Reunion tomorrow?” Jade asked on Instagram ahead of TMFR’s second episode.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“No one you ruined the first episode," one person replied.</p><p>Clearly the comment didn’t sit well with Ms. Cline who responded almost immediately.</p><p>“For 1, y’all say you hate the drama but eat it tf up lol so plz," she wrote.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“For 2, I’m glad we got major issues out of the way at the beginning so we can all move forward. Water under the bridge at this point.”</p><p>In a separate post, Jade explained that the Ashley fight was not nearly as intense as it looked.</p><p>“Editing makes everything look slightly different lol,” she wrote.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“We were all there for hours and we were doing fine until the verrry end once we were all drinking and tired," Cline continued.</p><p>“It was crazyyy but def a huge learning lesson. I learned so much about myself. Would do it again!”</p><p>We know what Jade is saying about the misleading editing — it’s something that countless reality stars have complained about in the past.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>But if a night ends on a crazy note, it was still a crazy night, regardless of how calm things may have been before.</p><p>Any time an evening ends in a fight, that’s really all anyone is gonna remember — and that’s true for non-reality stars, too!</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2V%2BcK3SoaOesV2fvK%2Bx0maqpZmdorKlecGyZK2dlaN6rrvMZp2apl2bvK24zrCgp59dqLWwr8qipaBlmpaxpnnCpaBo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
