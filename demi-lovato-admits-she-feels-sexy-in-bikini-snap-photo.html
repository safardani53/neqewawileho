“Idk what to caption this.. reality is I’m sitting at the gym post jiu jitsu feeling high on life and drinking my post workout shake,” the 26-year-old singer captioned a Wednesday, May 15, Instagram pic of herself lying down wearing a leopard two-piece. “I’m sweaty and not looking this glamorous right now but f–k I feel awesome and posting this feels empowering because I like this pic where I feel sexy and I can also defend myself from anyone that ever tries to attack me."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I may be posting a lot of pics in the next few days.. I’m sorry in advance.”</p><p>The “Sober” songstress followed up with similar shots on Monday, May 13. “I <a href=#>adora Bora Bora</a>,” she gushed on Instagram.</p><p>Lovato traveled to the tropical locale with friends <strong>Sara Elizabeth Mitchell</strong> and <strong>Matthew Scott Montgomery</strong>. “<a href=#>Thank you for never leaving me in my darkest moments</a>, for always drying my tears.. even when they’re from watching&nbsp;Moana,” she told her pals in a Tuesday, May 14, post. “Thank you for being loyal, honest and so grateful for every little thing. … I’m so lucky to be best friends with two incredible souls who are so talented and creative because it inspires me daily.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Grammy nominee added: “You never abandoned me like others did when I was going through s–t.. you were there to listen, without judgement [sic] and only love and I can never fully express what that means to me. You’re the greatest friends I’ve EVER had and our future together is so bright.”</p><p>Lovato suffered a near-fatal overdose in July 2018. She completed a 90-day rehab stay late last year. Us Weekly exclusively revealed in March that the Disney Channel alum briefly <a href=#>checked herself back into treatment</a> for approximately two weeks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGadnZ2eeq271ZqrqGWRmbqqwNJmqqGdXZuyprjSZqqesKlitq95waKioqaZYsCvrc9mp6GnpKR8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
