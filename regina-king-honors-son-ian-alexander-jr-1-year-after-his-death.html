His spirit is the thread that connects us.”</p><p class=p1>She continued: “Of course, orange is your favorite color. It’s the fire and the calm. I see you in everything I [breathe].

Our family asks for respectful consideration during this private time. Thank you.”</p><p class=p1>Following Ian’s death, the Oscar winner <a href=#>has been supported by her famous friends</a> as she grieves the loss of her only child.</p><p class=p1>“My friend. I think of you often. I always pray for your strength & peace in the midst of loss and grief. I love you&nbsp;<span class=s1>🧡🧡🧡</span>,”<a href=#><strong> Niecy Nash</strong></a> wrote via Instagram comment on Friday.</p><p class=p1><a href=#><strong>Yvonne Orji</strong></a>, for her part, added: “Love, healing and peace to you in abundance.”</p><p class=p1>King — who welcomed her only child in 1996 with her then-husband, now 64 — long <a href=#>had a special bond with Ian</a> as he grew up.</p><p class=p1>“I get emotional because my son is an amazing young man, and it took me to be a mother for me to realize how incredible of a woman [my mother] is,” the&nbsp;<i>If Beale Street Could Talk&nbsp;</i>star previously gushed during&nbsp;a <a href=#>CNN “Red Chair Interview”</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;October 2020. “You don’t know what unconditional love is. You may say you do, but if you don’t have a child, you don’t know what that is. But when you experience it, it is the most fulfilling ever. So, that is the greatest part about me. Being a mom to Ian.”</p><p class=p1>The late “Work It Out” singer, who <a href=#>performed under the stage name</a> Desduné, was equally proud that King was his mother.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“Happy birthday&nbsp;to my co, so extremely proud of you and inspired by your love, artistry, and gangsta! To be able to watch you take this lifetime by its neck and make it yours is something I will forever be grateful for,” Ian wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a> in January 2021, sharing a sweet birthday tribute to the actress. “But to have you as my mother is the greatest gift I could ask for. To be all that you are while always having the time to be there, love and support me unconditionally is truly remarkable. The whole marvel universe ain’t got s—t on you, [you’re] the real superhero! Love you mom!
