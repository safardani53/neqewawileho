The full outfit consisted of a tight black corset paired with a long black sequined coat and a feathered headpiece. Like we said, Grace Jones made sure she was the center of attention during her time on stage and the outfit helped her accomplish that."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In 2019, it was rumored that the singer would make a cameo in the new film, 34 years after she appeared alongside <strong>Roger Moore</strong> in A View To A Kill.&nbsp;It’s not clear why she walked away from the role and the chance to return to the long-running franchise, but according to the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Sun</a>,&nbsp;Grace wasn’t happy with the script.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/grace-jones-london-ball-SS-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>“Bosses were really excited about landing her. Of course, she comes with a reputation, so they organized premium accommodation and rolled out the red carpet on set to make her feel welcome,” a source previously told The Sun. “But it turns out Grace was expecting to play a bigger role in the movie and took her brief cameo as a slight.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>It’s a shame Grace Jones won’t appear in the new James Bond movie, but at least she’s still performing and fans get to enjoy her talents on stage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5BwZqCqkZiybrbOp5ysZZKksbq%2F1KKrZqGTpLtursClo2akn6OxsLqMn5isoJmku27DxJ6iZqiYpMGwv44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
