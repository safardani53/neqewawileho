I carry a picture of them with me all the time," he said in 2009.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actor echoed the sentiment to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Esquire</a> in 2010. "I've got incredible pride for my family," he told the publication. "I've absolutely fallen into that cliché of a dad who could just happily talk about my daughter endlessly, but it's not what I'm about in terms of being an actor. I don't want people to know about that."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So, who captured Christian Bales's heart?

Blažić and Bale reportedly <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>met through Ryder</a>, who starred alongside the actor in the 1994 adaptation of Little Women.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-was-previously-a-model-makeup-artist-and-stunt-driver></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She was previously a model</strong>, makeup artist and stunt driver</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jason Merritt/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to her work as a personal assistant, Blažić is also a former model and makeup artist. She was reportedly <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>featured as a model</a> in the late makeup artist Kevyn Aucoin's New York Times best-selling book, Face Forward, alongside subjects like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Celine Dion</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Julianne Moore</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Sharon Stone</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Blažić also has experience as a stunt driver — including on the Bale-helmed Batman movie, The Dark Knight Rises.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My wife was a stunt driver, she was chasing me through the city in Batman," Bale told the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Wall Street Journal</a> in 2014. "She was driving one of the cop cars. She can do 180s and stunts and all that. She terrifies me.

"I never planned to marry. Everyone was divorced in my family so I didn't have very healthy ideas about marriage," he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>told Easy Living magazine</a> in July 2012. "Then I met Sibi and suddenly it seemed a fantastic idea."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actor had previously <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told Interview magazine</a> in 2001 that he assumed he'd be in his mid-30s before he felt prepared to settle down. "But I suddenly found that I'd met somebody and I said, "Screw it. I'm not gonna sit here saying, 'Oh no, I'm not ready,' and regret not having done this later on and the possibility of not having this person around," he said of meeting Blažić.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bale's own father David gave marriage another shot when he married <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Gloria Steinem</a> shortly after Bale and Blažić tied the knot in 2000, making Blažić the activist's stepdaughter-in-law. When asked how he felt about his father's second union, Bale told Interview that he and Sibi were looking forward to spending time with David and Steinem.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My wife and I will be spending a few weeks with the two of them soon, and it'll be fantastic because I've been accustomed to my father always being alone," he said.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-and-bale-celebrated-their-19th-wedding-anniversary-with-a-california-bike-ride></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She and Bale celebrated their 19th wedding anniversary with a California bike ride</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Jan. 29, 2019, the pair was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>photographed</a> on a casual bike ride on the Pacific Palisades coastline for their 19th wedding anniversary — which also happened to be the day before Bale's 45th birthday.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During their leisurely ride, both wore black sunglasses and sneakers. Blažić was dressed in a black T-shirt and leggings while Bale sported black shorts and a grey button-up.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-and-bale-share-two-children></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She and Bale share two children</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple welcomed their daughter, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Emmeline Bale</a>, in 2005, and their son, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Joseph Bale</a>, in 2014.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Emmeline is following in her mom's fashion footsteps.

"Say less right now, she knows the dumb crap that can come out of my mouth sometimes. I can sink and ruin a perfectly good movie and a so-so career in one speech. I wouldn't be working without her."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He continued, "And thank you for our beautiful children, Banana and Burrito. They've given me a love and a soul I never thought possible."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-bale-credits-his-wife-with-much-of-his-career-success></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Bale credits his wife with much of his career success</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Todd Williamson/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Over the years, Bale has often credited Blažić with improving his craft. "My wife and daughter come with me on location. It's the most ideal mix," he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>told Parade</a> in 2008. "These wonderful distractions actually make me better at what I do."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In another acceptance speech gushing about Blažić, Bale mentioned that many of his notoriously <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>drastic physical transformations</a> for roles would have been "impossible" without her support.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I truly believe you can't really celebrate something like this without having your partner with you because making movies takes so much time," he told the press after winning the 2011 Critics Choice Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in The Fighter.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She's had to be married to so many different characters over our marriage … I know it truly would be impossible to do it without her. She's such a good, strong woman."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bale has also joked that Blažić prefers some of the characters he plays over him.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My wife definitely had favorites. She was like, 'Ah, I miss him. He's gone. You're a d—. I want you to be that character again," he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>told PEOPLE</a> in November 2019.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for his wife's favorite character? "[Sibi] actually really liked Trevor Reznik, from The Machinist," he shared. "I think it's just about him and me just f—— sitting there being too weak to be able to do anything. Totally incapable."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Blažić has also supported Bale on the red carpet, including a September 2022 outing for the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>premiere of Bale's new film Amsterdam</a>. The two were seen smiling and holding hands during the event in New York City. Bale wore a dark suit paired with black shoes while Blažić was photographed in a black velvet pant suit paired with red heels.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ52kw6qx0miuoaddnsBuv8iboGaanJbHqq%2BMnJ%2BroaOptqK6jJuYpZ1f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
