The blind 58-year-old opera singer was horseback riding in Italy on Sept. 14 when he was bucked off and hit his head, according to a report from <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ.</a>&nbsp;The icon was taken by helicopter to a hospital to get treated for his injuries.

It was just a trivial fall from a horse,” he tweeted, nonchalantly. Can nothing slow this guy down?! Despite his age and disability, Andrea is somewhat of a thrill-seeker. He’s been spotted riding bikes, windsurfing, skiing and doing more fun outside stuff. We highly doubt this fall will slow him down at all!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Andrea has been a big fan of horseback riding for a long time. “It’s my culture. I love the challenge,” he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>DailyMail</a>. “I made my parents suffer a lot when I was younger. Every day I take risks with my life. With the bicycle, with the horses, in the sea, everywhere. I probably have an angel. A very careful guardian angel,” he joked. We love his zeal for life! Never chance, Andrea, and recover quickly!</p><p lang=it dir=ltr>Carissimi, desidero tranquillizzarvi e dirvi che sto benissimo: si è trattato solo di una banale caduta da cavallo.<br>Vi abbraccio.<br>– Andrea</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>— Andrea Bocelli (@AndreaBocelli) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>September 14, 2017</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, send your best wishes to Andrea, below!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlnZH16e5BtZpqmlKeyonnBqJqepJyeeqm70qmgrZmcnsemsIyfmKWkmaO0brvFn2Shp6Kosm6tyKujop6kmrFw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
