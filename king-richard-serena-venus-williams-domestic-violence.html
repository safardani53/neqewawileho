Ms. Williams stated she did not wish to report any information to the police, nor did she request them.</p><p><strong>The news comes as:</strong></p><p>"I explained to Ms. Williams that it was the obligation of the medical personnel to contact law enforcement agency whenever suspected domestic violence occurs.</p><p>"At this point, I questioned Ms. Williams as to what happened and she stated she hurt her wrist. I asked her where this occurred, and she stated it was at her house [in Palm Beach Gardens].</p><p>"When I asked what happened again, she stated she hurt herself. She then stated later she was hurt by someone, but she would not reveal the <a href=#>identity of the perpetrator</a>."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>Officer Enstrom explained hospital personnel claimed Ms. Williams had originally stated that a door handle had hit her, but her injuries were "not consistent with a door handle hitting someone in that portion of the body."</p><p>The report shows <a href=#>Serena</a> and Venus were with their mother at the hospital who were "very evasive" towards the officer when questioned separately, and insisted it was not their mother's wish to report any information.</p><p><strong>Read our <a href=#>King Richard live blog</a> for the very latest news and updates...</strong></p><p>"I explained to the two daughters that domestic violence is a serious crime and needs to be placed in check and the perpetrator as well as the vicim both need help," Enstrom went on.</p><p>"In my attempts to urge the daughters to cooperate, Serena stated if she had seen something, she would have reported it to me, However, Venus was adamant it was not the mother's wish to say anything more and remained silent."</p><p>Enstrom was advised the only other person living at the property besides the mother and her two daughters was <a href=#>Richard Williams</a>, but Serena and Venus said they did not believe he was home at the time.</p><p>"I again spoke to Ms. Williams and urged her to be forthright with me as to what had occurred. Ms. Williams stated to me, 'I know you know what happened, but I am fearful for my daughters' careers,'" he wrote in the bombshell report.</p><p>"The complainant stated because both of her daughters' careers and their high profile claimed this incident would hurt them, and again I explained the domestic violence cycle.</p><h2>HIS WIFE WAS 'FEARFUL'</h2><p>"It is highly suspected by myself that Ms. Williams may have been assaulted by either her spouse and/or another family member, however, she remained adamant at not talking to me any further."</p><p>The Sun has reached out to the <a href=#>Williams family</a>, including Richard's lawyer, for comment but did not hear back.</p><p>Officer Enstrom said he supplied her with a refusal to prosecute form which she signed without hesitation after he explained it to her.</p><p>He gave her the case number and his information in case she changed her mind and she insisted she would call if she did.</p><p>"At this time, Ms. Williams was in a hurry to leave the hospital and they could no longer detain her against her will and she then left," he explained.</p><p>"I then spoke to Dr. De La Guerra, attending E.R physician at this facility.</p><p>"Dr. De La Guerra stated Ms. Williams had suffered three fractured ribs on the left side of her body, which did not appear to be serious in nature.</p><p>"He stated he attempted also to ascertain how these ribs were broken or whom may have done it and met with negative results."</p><p>Police later visited the Williams residence to investigate further, but Richard's wife was not home, and they left a domestic violence packet in the mail box, according to the report.</p><p>Years later, <a href=#>the National Enquirer</a> published a denial from Richard after he was asked about assaulting his wife.</p><p>He claimed her injuries were caused by a jet-ski accident while he was away in Chicago, saying: "So far, I have only proven to be a good husband, I have a good wife and I am a good father."</p><p>But when asked about her injuries by a reporter for the tabloid, Oracene finally broke her silence, saying simply: "I don't jet-ski."</p><p>According to an article on thesmokinggun.com, Oracene, now 69, also called 911 two years before the alleged incident when she thought her husband might shoot himself with a pellet gun.</p><p>During that time, she was also allegedly given a 'Domestic Violence Legal Rights Package'.</p><h2>PREVIOUS 911 CALL</h2><p>Meanwhile, Serena and Venus's half-sister, <a href=#>Sabrina Williams, has slammed her estranged father</a>, 79, who she claims is painted as a saint in the new Will Smith movie, despite walking out on his first family.</p><p>"He thinks he's the king of the world, but no one that's ever been around him thinks he's King Richard," she told The Sun in <a href=#>an exclusive interview</a>. "It is an outrageous title, but to truth be told, it fits him.</p><p>"He's not the king of the world. If you look at him psychologically, it's something he's never achieved apart from in his head - he's lived only through two of his daughters forsaking all his other children.&nbsp;</p><p>"Truth be told, those girls rose to the top while his other children had to suffer because of the choices my dad made, we were raised in poverty after he left."</p><p>Richard&nbsp;married Sabrina's late mom Betty Johnson in Los Angeles in the early 1960 and they had <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">four other children</a>&nbsp;together - Richard III, 56, Ronner, 55, Reluss, 54, and Reneeka, 49.&nbsp;</p><p>But, when Sabrina was just eight, Richard allegedly dumped his wife and five kids â€“ telling the little girl he was going to buy her a bike, but never returning.</p><p>Richard then married Oracene, Serena and Venus's mother, in 1980, but they divorced in 2002.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>He is now going through his third divorce having married his much younger wife, Lakeisha Graham, who has also accused him of bad behavior in a series of bombshell court documents.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/11/b796ac18-3fd9-4f8f-85e8-d6c080f85cdf-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000696313746-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000696314494-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000693909386.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Will Smith looks unrecognisable with a new goatee on The One Show as he promotes new film King Richard about Venus and Serena Williams</span><p><strong>If you or someone you know is affected by any of the issues raised in this story, call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at&nbsp;1-800-799-7233&nbsp;or chat at&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">thehotline.org</a>.</strong></p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hsYWyEdIOYaKKippdiv6qvx5qpnWWjmr%2BmusBmrZ6mpah6uLXLpaCapaNisbC5xKyroptdq7awuMSnmp5n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
