And honestly, I didn’t even recognize myself,” Simpson, 47, exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>on Tuesday, July 25, while promoting <a href=#>the current season of&nbsp;<i>RHOC</i></a>. “I was like, ‘Who is that?’ And then I was like, ‘Oh, that’s me.’ I really neglected myself those four months that we were filming. I ate too much, drank too much, didn’t go to the gym, didn’t work out and I felt really down, really depressed, really dark when we finished filming.”</p><p class=p1>Once filming wrapped, Simpson underwent a full blood panel during a doctor’s appointment — where the medical professional <a href=#>floated the idea of trying either Ozempic</a> or a similar semaglutide.</p><p class=p1>“At that time I <a href=#>didn’t even know what Ozempic was</a> honestly,” she recalled to&nbsp;<i>Us.&nbsp;</i>“The doctor was just like, ‘Oh,&nbsp;there’s this new weight loss drug and it’s just been FDA approved and it’s great. I think it would really help you lose some weight and you’ll feel better and you’ll be able to get working out again and feeling more like yourself.’ And I was like, ‘OK, sounds great.’ Anyway, I did that in December. It was great for my diet. It really just kickstarted me into eating better and eating healthier ’cause it makes you feel like crap ’cause nothing tastes good.”</p><p class=p1>While the controversial drug — which is <a href=#>designed to help individuals who struggle</a> with weight-related issues — helped get Simpson on the right track, she <a href=#>also revamped her diet and exercise routine</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/RHOC-s-Emily-Simpson-Doesn-t-Recognize-Herself-in-Photos-Before-Weight-Loss.jpg><p class=p1>“I cut out a lot of things and I go to the gym seven days a week and work &nbsp;out. I work out like I’m training for a fitness competition. … That’s kind of the whole story,” she said on Tuesday. “The thing that bothers me the most is that when people comment on the way that I look, they constantly say,&nbsp;‘Ozempic,&nbsp;Ozempic.’ And it’s like, yes, I did <a href=#>use that nine months ago</a> or however many months ago it was, but I don’t like that it discounts all the hard work I put in. I don’t care if you say that all you want, but at least gimme credit for seven days a week, getting up at 6&nbsp;a.m. every morning and busting my butt in the gym every single day.”</p><p class=p1>The Bravo star further explained that she did not want to use Ozempic “for long” and only to get a “jumpstart” on her new wellness regimen.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“It was very motivating when I started to notice that I was eating better and I’d lost a little weight and then <a href=#>the liposuction [in my arms]</a> was helpful,” she told&nbsp;<i>Us</i>. “It was a good kickstart for me, but it was very difficult for me to function. I have three small children, so I couldn’t feel like that all the time. I can’t constantly feel nauseous. So it was very short-lived, but it was very effective.”</p><p class=p1><i>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaepZmhxm6%2FyKanrKeeYrGwsdKnq2aqlZi8qLrIs5xmoJWnwKa4xWanq51drLKqs8etZKWno6h6ta3LpKpmp6qaurG1wmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
