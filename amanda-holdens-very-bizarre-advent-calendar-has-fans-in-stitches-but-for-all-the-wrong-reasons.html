Leaving the traditional chocolate advent calendar to the general public, Amanda’s personalised offerings for each day range from festive to the downright random.

Here’s a rundown of what the <a href=#>Britain’s Got Talent</a> host has been spamming her fans with on Instagram for the last three weeks…</p><p><strong>Day 1</strong></p><p>On the first day of Christmas, Amanda has a sing-song.</p><p>She sings: “On the first day of Christmas Amanda said to me, do you fancy a cup of tea? Or a gin?”</p><p>While we’d always go for gin, we’re not sure why Amanda is referring to herself in the third person.</p><p>Maybe she’s been on that gin she’s recommending…</p><p><strong>Day 2</strong></p><p>Amanda’s clearly getting into the Christmas spirit on day two of advent – she’s now referring to herself as Handy Mandy. No, us neither.</p><p>Her festive tip is to use an ironing board if you’re running out of work surface space at home.</p><p>Which actually could be useful when you’re making that job lot of mince pies. Maybe.</p><p>Thanks for that one, Handy Mandy.</p><p><strong>Day 3</strong></p><p>Planning for the future is Amanda’s forte, and on day three of advent she’s recommending that we reuse our Christmas wreaths as hats for Ascot.</p><p>Please remind us of this come, June, Amanda - we tend to shove our Christmas decorations right at the back of the loft in the first week of January.</p><p><strong>Day 4</strong></p><p>Bless Amanda – it’s hard to come up with Christmas ideas every single day.</p><p>In her fourth video she’s singing the praises of hair crimpers.</p><p>This has nothing to do with Christmas – at all – but at least we’ve got an idea for that 80s fancy dress party coming up in February…</p><p><strong>Day 5</strong></p><p>Now this is an idea we can get down with.</p><p>Amanda recommends ordering in your Christmas dinner from a catalogue in her fifth video.</p><p>High five, lady.</p><p><strong>Day 6</strong></p><p>On day six Amanda is recommending that we buy personalised gifts from a well-known personalised gift website.</p><p>The part we can’t get past is the Phil Mitchell-esque voice that Manda is doing in the video. We think she’s pretending to be her dog, Rudie, but she’s a dead ringer for Phil.</p><p>Amanda, you should be gunning for a part as Phil’s lost sister on <a href=#>EastEnders</a>, seriously.</p><p><strong>Day 7</strong></p><p>Amanda’s gone all Charlie Chaplin on us in video seven, which is in silence and sees her doing a jig in front of some sparkly wreaths.</p><p>We need a bit more explanation, Amanda – subtitles would do it if you want to go full silent movie style…</p><p><strong>Day 8</strong></p><p>Thank goodness, for Amanda’s got her voice back for day eight and she’s singing her little heart out again.</p><p>About gin. Again. We think we know what Amanda wants for Christmas…</p><p>Nice tree, by the way, Amanda.</p><p><strong>Day 9</strong></p><p>Day nine is also dedicated to gin. Amanda, you’re a girl after our own hearts.</p><p>In this video, she’s got a toy unicorn drinking out of a bowl of gin, and she’s doing a strange Bond-villain style laugh.</p><p>Looking good in that red dress, though, Amanda.</p><p><strong>Day 10</strong></p><p>Amanda has now stopped drinking gin – probably best to have the day off – and is promoting a range of bath products for mums.</p><p>Sounds nice to us, but we’re kind of missing the gin-sozzled videos…</p><p><strong>Day 11</strong></p><p>Amanda is getting stuck into the mince pies and is back on the booze (again) on day 11, just like us normals.</p><p>She’s also doing a shot with a random man in an Adidas jumper over a bar. Which sounds like a standard Christmas Eve at the pub us.</p><p><strong>Day 12</strong></p><p>Oh, Amanda. She’s playing the piano for us now, but only for a second, before plugging a swanky beauty oil.</p><p>Please just stick to the singing, Amanda.</p><p><strong>Day 13</strong></p><p>Mandy is doing a pretend fall over a Christmas present on day 13.</p><p>Ah, we get it now – it’s because 13 is an unlucky number. Very funny, Amanda, very funny.</p><p>We bet <a href=#>David Walliams</a> is quaking in his boots…</p><p><strong>Day 14</strong></p><p>Amanda’s stuck the number 14 to her chest for, well, day 14.</p><p>And she’s pulling apart a Christmas tree to demonstrate how to spy on your neighbours and their decorations.</p><p>She writes: <a href=#>#ThenameisMandy</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>#007</a>”.</p><p>We don’t think that <a href=#>Daniel Craig</a> would be very impressed with this offering at all.</p><p>Nor for a millisecond do we believe that Amanda’s got a fake Christmas tree in her house (we saw the real one earlier…), but we appreciate the sentiment.</p><p><strong>Day 15</strong></p><p>On day 15 Amanda does her bit for charity by wearing a Christmas jumper and raising awareness for Save The Children’s Christmas jumper appeal.</p><p>Good on you for this one Amanda – we’re being very sincere here, too.</p><p><strong>Day 16</strong></p><p>Amanda is now hiding in a bin. Even the newly-crowned queen of Christmas (<a href=#>sorry, Kris Jenner</a>) is running low on ideas for her advent calendar at this point.</p><p>“This is just rubbish,” she declares. Her words, not ours.</p><p><strong>Day 17</strong></p><p>Amanda advises us to invest in a hospital screen to hide behind and mask any weight gain over Christmas.</p><p>Not sure that’ll come in time for Christmas Day, to be quite honest. We’ll just hide under a blanket on the sofa like we normally do, if that’s OK with you.</p><p><strong>Day 18</strong></p><p><a href=#>Jamie Oliver</a> has made a guest appearance for day 19, which is actually very impressive and has seriously jazzed up this whole Amanda-on-her-own thing.</p><p>He advises us on basting your bird on Christmas Day. Handy.</p><p>Amanda calls him a “dirty beast”. Her words, not ours.</p><p><strong>Day 19</strong></p><p>We thought this was an advent calendar, but day 19 seems to be more of a saucy home video between Amanda and husband Chris Hughes.</p><p>She poses in red silk lingerie and looks very lovely indeed.</p><p>Not sure what it has to do with Christmas, though…</p><p><strong>Day 20</strong></p><p>Amanda is now advising us to take lots of pictures over Christmas – and hams up the joke by stealing a photo of herself off the wall and running off with it.</p><p>We see what you did there, Amanda. Very funny.</p><p><strong>Day 21</strong></p><p><a href=#>Rylan Clark-Neal</a> and <a href=#>Peter Andre</a> have turned up for cameos on day 21.</p><p>There’s simply nothing more that Amanda can do apart from draft in her celeb pals after 21 videos. We repeat, 21 videos. And there are still more to come, folks.</p><p>We salute her for her efforts, but how is she ever going to keep this thing going until day 24 of advent?</p><p><strong>Day 22</strong></p><p>Now that Amanda’s run out of famous friends to feature on her videos, she’s got the ultimate cameo – Father Christmas.</p><p>And she is putting lip balm on him.</p><p>The mind boggles. Amanda, you have done yourself proud here.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Amanda Holden ​sparkles in a glittering silver dress</span><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN TV & SHOWBIZ</h2></p><p>And the good news and final Christmas present for all Amanda fans, is that there’s another two more videos left to come on December 23 and 24.</p><p>Plus probably one on Christmas Day, too.</p><p>Bet you can’t wait.</p><p><strong>Got a story?</strong>&nbsp;email&nbsp;<a href=#>digishowbiz@the-sun.co.uk</a>&nbsp;or call us direct on 02077824220.</p><p><strong>We pay for videos too</strong>.
