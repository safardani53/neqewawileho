Even at the age of 17, Bubba was named 2010 NASCAR K&N Rookie of the Year!</p><p>Since 2012, Bubba has won the NASCAR K&N Pro Series East, the NASCAR Gander RV and the Cars Super Late Model Tour series, to name just a few of his successes.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Looking forward to seeing <a href=#>@BubbaWallace</a> today as part of the <a href=#>@NASCAR</a> race in LA.

It was his best finish of the season!</p><p>It came a year after he made the big decision to leave Richard Petty Motorsports. It wasn’t always a smooth process for Bubba, as in April 2021, the racer’s top finish was still his 17th place finish, when he was involved in a last-lap crash.</p><p>However, the racer has since been described as on of the “best superspeedway drivers currently in NASCAR”. And his Netflix documentary only highlights just how passionate he is when it comes to the sport.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Bubba Wallace is one of the best superspeedway drivers currently in NASCAR <a href=#>#NASCAR</a></p>— Daniel Kriete (@DanielKriete4) <a href=#>February 22, 2022</a></figure>View Tweet<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-car-racer-s-salary>The car racer’s salary</h2><p>Bubba reportedly makes around&nbsp;$2.2million&nbsp;with his 23XI Racing contract.

Bubba, 28, is the youngest driver to succeed at Franklin County Speedway, so his wealthy salary makes total sense.</p><p>Considering the average driver on the team reportedly gets paid $112,038, he’s doing well for himself on the higher end of salaries.
