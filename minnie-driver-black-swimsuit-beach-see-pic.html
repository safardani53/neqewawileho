The actress looked fresh-faced and simply glowed in the sunlight. Minnie’s swimsuit looked great on the star. She fashioned a black swim shirt that appeared to have some sheer fabric featured on the sleeves, as well.<p id=content-paragraph-4>She wore a matching set of bottoms, too. Minnie <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>looked great in her beach day apparel,</a> and appeared to have such a great time relaxing and taking some time away from her busy schedule. Indeed, Minnie’s 2021 has been rather exciting! When it comes to work projects, she appeared in an episode of the Amazon series&nbsp;Modern Love and in an episode of the lauded HBO Max series&nbsp;Starstruck.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Minnie-Driver-Black-Swimsuit-Beach-embed-2.jpg>Of course, Minnie has another project on the horizon that fans simply cannot wait to see!
