Indeed, the “Super Bass” singer, 31, has ditched her trademark colorful hairstyles and wild makeup in favor of a more ladylike style for The Other Woman premiere in Los Angeles on April 21 and at the MTV Movie Awards on April 13.
Since splitting with her main wig man, Terrence Davidson, in January 2013, Minaj has worn mainly blonde hairstyles."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

So I created that wavy, super-blonde hair with the dark roots — the wig.”</p><p>While the blonde wigs were a step to a more natural look, James says Minaj has since totally ditched the wigs. “Now she’s wearing her real hair,” the celeb stylist, who also works with <strong><a href=#>Halle Berry</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Beyonce</a></strong>, said. “So I just follow her lead. When she would ask me, ‘Well, what do you think I should do?’ I usually bring things that are a little more stylized because I feel like that’s who she is, but, surprising even to me, she’s been leaning toward even more natural. She wants to do less. Just less, less, less.”</p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Nicki Minaj MTV Movie Awards" width=467 height=665 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>That apparently meant returning to her naturally dark brown hair. The “Right Thru Me” singer has shared plenty of pictures of her brunette locks on Instagram, but she debuted it on the red carpet at the MTV Movie Awards. “We talked about maybe changing the color a little and she was adventurous at the MTV Movie Awards, where we added a few extensions just to give it a little more pop,” James said. “I didn’t think she would but once I did it, she loved it.”</p><p>Although the stylist prefers wigs since all of the styling, color, and heat can severely damage hair, Minaj, who recently released her latest fragrance Minajesty, is staying away from them. “I’m trying to gradually get her back into wigs, but she’s adamant now,” he says. “She doesn’t want it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6O2pLfIZqSippGfeq%2Bt066pmqRdna6qvtKtsKWdXajBurjIrKtmamBmgXN%2Bk2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
