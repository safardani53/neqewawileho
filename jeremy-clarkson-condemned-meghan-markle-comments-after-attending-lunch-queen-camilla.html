The article was taken down from The Sun's website on Monday with the message: "In light of Jeremy Clarkson's tweet he has asked us to take last week's column down."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Published Friday by the U.K. outlet, the Top Gear host said in the article that he hated the Duchess of Sussex "on a cellular level."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"At night, I'm unable to sleep as I lie there, grinding my teeth and dreaming of the day when she is made to parade naked through the streets of every town in Britain while the crowds chant, 'Shame!' and throw lumps of excrement at her," he wrote, referencing the famous scene from Game of Thrones.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Clarkson also wrote that he hated Meghan more than Rose West, referencing the notorious English serial killer who — with her husband, Fred West — tortured and murdered numerous young women as well as her stepdaughter in the 1970s and 1980s.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Nick England/Getty; Chris Jackson/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon, who was also named in the article as someone that Clarkson "hates," called what the presenter said "deeply misogynist and just downright awful and horrible."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I think what he said about <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Meghan Markle</a> was deeply misogynist and just downright awful and horrible," she said, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>The Times</a>. "My overwhelming emotion about guys like Jeremy Clarkson is pity. I mean, what is it that makes somebody so distorted by hate that they end up writing these things? I think that possibly gives an insight into Jeremy Clarkson and the kind of person he is. So maybe he just needs to take a step back from things and just think about life a bit more."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Mayor of London Sadiq Khan <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>condemned the article</a> via Twitter, writing: "As Jeremy Clarkson should well know - words have consequences. The words in his piece are no joke - they're dangerous and inexcusable. We are in an epidemic of violence against women and girls and men with powerful voices must do better than this."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Clarkson's daughter Emily also added to the backlash. "My views are and have always been clear when it comes to misogyny, bullying and the treatment of women by the media," she wrote on her Instagram story. "I want to make it very clear that I stand against everything that my dad wrote about <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Meghan Markle</a>, and I remain standing in support of those that are targeted with online hatred."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Clarkson responded on Twitter Monday, saying he was "horrified to have caused so much hurt."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Oh dear. I've rather put my foot in it," he wrote. "In a column I wrote about Meghan, I made a clumsy reference to a scene in Game of Thrones and this has gone down badly with a great many people. I'm horrified to have caused so much hurt and I shall be more careful in future."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A spokesperson for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex declined to comment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Last week, Clarkson went to a Christmas lunch also attended by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Queen Camilla</a> at Michelin-starred restaurant Murano in London. The event — hosted by Ewan Venters, former head of Fortnum & Mason — also saw guests such as Maggie Smith, Judi Dench and Piers Morgan.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Clarkson's article came amid the release of Meghan and <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Prince Harry</a>'s Netflix docuseries, in which the couple detailed their struggles with press intrusion and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>social media threats</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I think for people to really understand, you know, when you plant a seed that is so hateful, what it can grow into," the Duchess of Sussex said in an emotional moment of the show.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Meghan Markle and Prince Harry.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>DANIEL LEAL/AFP</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Just a couple of days ago, I was going through the manual for our security team at home, and on one of the pages that I happened to flip to, it was about online monitoring," she continued. "And they're like: 'If you see a tweet like this, please report it to the head of security immediately.' And it just said: 'Meghan just needs to die. Someone needs to kill her. Maybe it should be me.' "</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"And I was just like, 'Okay.' That's, like, what's actually out in the world because of people creating hate," Meghan said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6KkxqK40mihnqqVosZur8uaqaSrn6N6pLvNnZymppWZeq6xxqGYp2Wdlr%2BsuMRmmqilnZq7tb%2BMmp2tnaJirrXAxKeboqaXYrm2usKhZKqtlZq7bq%2FApqClpJFk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
