And after watching his recent interviews, fans want to know what happened to his eye?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Mr. Serv-On have a glass eye?</h2><p>It's always a trip to see the artists and celebrities you looked up to as a youngin' all grown up, and because it's been years or maybe decades since you've seen them last, when you finally do get a good look at them, it can be surprising to see how much they've changed.</p><p>The biggest difference folks have noticed with the New-Orleans-based rapper is that his left eye has some discoloration.</p><p>This has led many folks to speculate that Mr. Serv-On, real name Corey Smith, is rocking a glass eye. However, he hasn't discussed this change in his physical appearance in recent interviews. He's primarily discussed the significance of his time spent with other high-level rappers, like being featured on a verse with Big Pun and being the first Southern rapper to actually shoot a music video in Times Square.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>While speaking on the Murder Master Music Show, Mr. Serv-On reminded everyone that the hip-hop landscape was much different in the mid-to late '90s â€” it was still very much an East and West coast-run show with the majority of rappers hailing from New York or California.

However, we can judge by the blueish-greyish discoloration in his left eye that it's most likely a cataract.</p><p>In metaphorical terms: having a cataract is like having a foggy windshield in your car.

The most common cause of this condition in some people is old age.
