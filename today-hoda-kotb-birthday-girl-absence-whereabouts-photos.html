Hoda's got the morning off," Savannah explained at the beginning of the broadcast.</p><p>"She's probably at Simone Biles' house right now and is like 'Go Simone!'"</p><p>This caused Craig to crack up.</p><p>Savannah did not address Craig being there, but instead got straight to the news of the day.</p><p>Craig typically joins Savannah and Hoda about 30 minutes into the program.</p><p>When one of them is out, Craig will take the co-host spot and&nbsp;<a href=#>Sheinelle Jones</a>&nbsp;will usually join the hosts.</p><p>However, on Monday, Sheinelle was absent as well, and Jacob Soboroff became the third host at the desk.</p><h2>HODA'S LATE NIGHT</h2><p>Hoda must have been catching up on sleep, as she, her daughters, and a friend stayed up until 5am on Sunday to watch the women's U.S. soccer team.</p><p>The U.S. competed against Sweden and ended with a tied score of zero.</p><p>The FIFA Women's World Cup is an international competition and is hosted by Australia and New Zealand this year.</p><p>This meant that anyone in the United States had to stay up late to watch the game, due to the time differences.</p><p>"We up!!! Go USA!!!!&nbsp;@uswnt," Hoda captioned her&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">post</a>.</p><p>In the post, Hoda was make-up free and smiled for a selfie with her daughters, as the game played in the background.</p><h2>BOOKED AND BUSY</h2><p>Before being absent from Today, Hoda announced a&nbsp;<a href=#>major career move</a>&nbsp;on the show.</p><p>The 58-year-old got emotional while sharing the news with fans as her upcoming project was inspired by her youngest daughter, Hope.</p><p>During Wednesday’s broadcast of&nbsp;<a href=#>Today</a>, Hoda revealed she has a new children’s book coming out.</p><p>The picture book, titled Hope is a Rainbow, comes out in March 2024.</p><p>Hoda&nbsp;shared: “A few years back, I wrote the book, I’ve Loved You Since Forever, and it was inspired by the birth of my daughter Haley.&nbsp;</p><p>“So, I’m bursting because I have a book coming out next March, and it’s inspired by my youngest daughter, Hope.”</p><p>She explained that the book is about “really looking for hope all around” yourself.</p><p>After showing the bright cover of Hoda’s upcoming release, Savannah Guthrie asked her co-star to tell a bit more about the story and how it came to be.</p><p>Hoda said: “It was based on my daughter, who, of course, I had dreamt of her and hoped for her, and her name just fell in.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"And she just reminds me that hope is around every corner. No matter what you go through, no matter what hardship you endure.”</p><p>She added that she’d actually written the book before Hope, four, got sick a few months ago, before adding that her daughter’s “on the mend” now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/msemail_LG_HODA_KOTB_365765368_1021317499042827_6996051560014594061_njpg-JS836664839.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/ch-GettyImages-1248351809jpg-JS805101480.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/NUP_200251_00043jpg-JS795496123.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwZ25%2FeISWaKuonJGueqm7w5pkpKekl3qjtdGtn52ZqWK0qr7LZpibq5WjsKZ51qGcq52Rl7y2wNJmp6GnpKTAcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
