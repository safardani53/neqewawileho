We’ve got answers below.</p><h2>Taylor is a married man.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>The NFL star is in fact married to <strong><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Taylin Gallacher Lewan</a>,&nbsp;</strong>and has been since back in 2018. They also share two daughters and live in Nashville. They appear to be an extremely <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>happy family,</a> as Taylin took to Instagram to share her support for her hubby in October of 2022. “Waiting for <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the love of my life</a> to wake up from surgery to climb this mountain all over again,” she wrote alongside a pic of the family sitting on the sidelines of a stadium.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“Couldn’t be more thankful for everyone whose continued to reach out over the last few weeks even if I haven’t responded. The support our family receives is a constant reminder of our blessings instead of succumbing to adversity.

On the show, reads their official site, the players “sit down with a guest and bring their ridiculous-yet-insightful personalities to discuss various topics surrounding their lives. Each episode will bring different personalities from all industries to provide insight and conversations that will educate, make you laugh, and give you an inside scoop on their fast-paced lives.”</p><h2>He’s a family man.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>As dad to little <strong>Wynne Rebel Lewan </strong>and<strong> Willow Lewan,&nbsp;</strong>Taylor likely keeps as busy at home as he does on the field. His wife Taylin posted a sweet video montage of the star playing with his daughters on Instagram for <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Father’s Day</a> 2022. “Happy Father’s Day to the man who does it all,” she captioned the video. “We couldn’t be luckier to have you.”</p><h2>He’s experienced some legal trouble.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Taylor-Lewan-5-Things-Jeffree-Star-SS-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-14>According to his official <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Wikipedia page</a>, Taylor ran into a little trouble back in 2013. He was arrested for allegedly assaulting a couple of Ohio State fans outside of a restaurant in December of 2013. He pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors — drunk and disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace charges.</p><h2>Taylor began his career at Michigan State.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>Before making his way in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the NFL</a>, Taylor played for the Michigan Wolverines from 2009-2013.
