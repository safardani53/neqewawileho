The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Democrat & Chronicle</a> reported that her parents were in the midst of a divorce, which could be part of the reason why Drexel was so invested in getting away for a little while. On the third day she was in Myrtle Beach, Drexel disappeared. All that remains of that day is a grainy photo of her in the lobby of a hotel. She was alone and didn't appear to be under duress.</p><p>Later, authorities would trace her cellphone to Georgetown, S.C., which is about 50 miles south of where Drexel was last seen. "Dozens of searches occurred there in the first few years. The trail eventually went cold," per Democrat & Chronicle.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In 2012, authorities turned the investigation to Raymond Moody, a registered sex offender who was staying at a hotel near where Drexel's cellphone emitted its final signal. Police searched his room but found nothing. Eventually, they got a break in the case.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Brittanee Drexel's body was found in 2022.</h2><p>On May 4, 2022, Raymond Moody was charged with <a href=#>obstruction of justice</a>. While in police custody, he confessed to the murder of Brittanee Drexel. Moody was then charged with "murder, kidnapping, and first-degree criminal sexual conduct in connection to Drexel’s disappearance," via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WMBF News</a>. Her cause of death was listed on the arrest warrants as "manual strangulation."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>On the same day of his arrest, Moody led authorities to Drexel's body. She was four feet underground, and the excavation process took four days. During his <a href=#>confession</a>, which was released to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Live 5 News</a>, Moody explained in horrifying detail what happened the night she vanished. Moody and his then-girlfriend, Angel Vause, picked up Drexel and asked her if she wanted to party. The three then traveled to a campsite in Georgetown.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I wasn't going to do anything. We were just having a good time," Moody told police. It wasn't until after Vause left that things turned deadly. Moody raped Drexel, panicked over what happened, and <a href=#>strangled</a> her.</p><p>When Vause returned, Moody had moved Drexel's body and told his girlfriend that Drexel got a call from her friends and decided to leave. Later that night, he returned to the campsite and buried Drexel in a different location. He donated her clothes and the clothes he was wearing, then threw her cellphone into a river.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where is Raymond Moody now?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Drexel's family provided heartbreaking <a href=#>victim impact statements</a> at the trial.
