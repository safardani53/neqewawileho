While embarking on a Great White Shark Cage Diving Crew tour in South Africa, as the tour's videographer, he came face to face with an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>apex predator</a>. "People seem to love the clip," the 31-year-old said of the great white shark footage, which is currently making its rounds on social media.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The unforgettable expedition took place in Klein Brak, Mossel Bay. Graham's GoPro Hero camera was recording when the great white appeared before the dive group. The device captured the aquatic inhabitant opening its large mouth, baring rows of razor-sharp teeth,</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the clip, the shark swims up to Graham in the murky South African waters. Per <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>National Geographic</a>, great whites can reach over 20 feet in length and weigh more than 4,000 pounds. Their massive muscles and mouth allow them to wreak havoc on their prey.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, Graham described his shark encounter as "gentle" and "super inquisitive." After approaching the diver, the shark lightly nudged the GoPro Hero attached to his head and swam away.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Newsflare</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Their electro receptors can pick up the GoPro, so they get super curious and come in close to investigate," Graham told Media Drum World, per the New York Post. "It was an incredibly gentle interaction from the shark. It was just trying to figure out what the strange electrical thingy in the water was."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Graham added that others who saw the incident may have been "freaked out," but he appreciated the rare moment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Having such a personal and gentle interaction with such a big animal felt extremely captivating," he confessed. And although movies like Jaws and Deep Blue Sea may not paint the predators in the best light, the U.K. diver wants individuals to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>respect the deep sea creatures</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I think humans have an instinctive fear of what they can't see and don't understand. If you get the chance to see them in the wild, go and see them, I guarantee your perception will change," he said earlier this year after a similar encounter.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Graham made it through his shark experience untouched, a Florida resident can't say the same. On July 14, Chris Pospisil, a University of Central Florida student, had a near-fatal interaction with a shark. The 21-year-old was surfing with his friend Reece Redish at New Smyrna Beach when a shark knocked him <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>off his surfboard</a>. The predator then latched onto the young man's foot.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The shark came from under me, on my board, and tipped me backwards off my board, and I was falling backwards, I saw my foot in his mouth, and it dragged me under," Pospisil recalled as he spoke to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>FOX affiliate WOFL-TV</a>. He credits Redish for helping him survive the terrifying ordeal.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block-callout-heading_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-heading mntl-text-block"></h3><p><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</a></strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Reece was already there, already on top of me, got me by my shirt, and pulled me on the board," Pospisil said. Once on shore, he hoped his injuries would be minimal. "I remember asking the lifeguard, '<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Am I going to lose my foot?</a>' He was like, 'I don't know, man,'" the college student added.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While noting that "The top of my foot is going to be numb in some areas for the rest of my life, and my foot might be stiff because they had to repair all seven tendons," Pospisil added that he is ready to return to the water. "It hasn't changed anything. I'm definitely going to keep surfing. It's my lifestyle, and it's something I love to do," he admitted.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5ensqLAjLCfoqyVYsCprdGkZJuhpJ67qHnDoq2eqqNitLC80ahknJmdmr%2BiedWim56nXWyCd4CQbWw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
