The gesture has been implemented for years, and it made headlines in 2016 when the U.S. was shocked that <a href=#>Donald Trump</a> was elected President of the United States of America.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Discussions about xenophobia, racism, discrimination, not to mention an utter obliteration of "class" in politics, emerged upon Trump's victory. Throngs of people began putting safety pins on their clothing to signify that they wouldn't stand for the acts groups of Trump supporters would commit in his name after he was elected.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>So safety pins during the era of Trump were to protest that line of xenophobic thinking, but what does it mean if someone wears one in 2021?</p><p>It could pertain to the horrible turn of events that occurred in Afghanistan.

It's all well and good to appear as an "ally," but the appearance of caring isn't the same as actually doing something for marginalized people, whether it be protesting or donating or calling your representatives or volunteering your time in another way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The safety pin is also being used to discuss taking extra measures in the COVID-19 pandemic.</h2><p>The Twitter account @SafetyPinDaily is sharing tons of news about the reported severity of COVID-19 spikes in specific areas while castigating anti-mask opposition.
