After Elizabeth’s casket lay in state in Scotland and England, the royal family held her state funeral later that month.</p><p class="x_p2 x_ContentPasted0"><a href=#><strong>Prince William</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Princess Kate </strong></a>attended the ceremony with their oldest two children: <a href=#><strong>Prince George</strong></a>, 10, and <a href=#><strong>Princess Charlotte</strong></a>, 8. Charles, meanwhile, was joined at the memorial by Camilla, 75, and <a href=#><strong>Prince Harry</strong></a> attended the ceremony with wife <a href=#><strong>Meghan Markle</strong></a>. (The Prince and Princess of Wales’ youngest child, Prince Louis, 5, along with Harry and Meghan’s two children, <a href=#><strong>Prince Archie</strong></a>, 4, and <a href=#><strong>Princess Lilibet</strong></a>, 2, were not present for the service.)</p><p class="x_p2 x_ContentPasted0">Elizabeth’s funeral also served as a reunion between Harry, 38, Meghan, 42, and the rest of the royals. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex <a href=#>have been at odds with The Firm</a> since their 2020 decision to step down from their senior royal duties. The queen’s funeral served as the second time Harry had seen his family since moving with Meghan to California. (He attended <a href=#>Prince Philip’s</a> funeral in April 2021.)</p><p class="x_p2 x_ContentPasted0">“Just recently, my brother and I were walking the same route [at Elizabeth’s funeral]. And we sort of joked to each other and said, ‘At least we know the way,’” Harry recalled during his January ITV interview, noting that the day felt “very similar” to his mother <a href=#>Princess Diana’s</a> funeral. “The only difference was the levels of emotion. Because our grandmother had finished life. There was more, I think, of a celebration and respect and recognition to what she had accomplished. Whereas our mother was taken away far too young.” (Diana, who shared Prince William and Prince Harry with Charles, died in August 1997&nbsp;at the age of 36 following a fatal car crash.)</p><p class="x_p2 x_ContentPasted0">Last month, a source exclusively told Us Weekly that Charles, William and Kate <a href=#>were still figuring out how to properly honor</a> the late queen on the first anniversary of her death.<span class="x_Apple-converted-space x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class="x_p2 x_ContentPasted0">“William, Kate and Charles are all still planning how they will commemorate the passing of the queen, the wounds still feel fresh and it’s been hard for them to find a way for a celebration that will match the gravitas the queen exuded,” the insider explained. “On September 8th there will be some acknowledgment or event, [but] the details are still being ironed out.”</p><p class="x_p2 x_ContentPasted0">The source added that Harry and Meghan would “<a href=#>likely not be in attendance</a>” should there be an official event, but “Charles will follow in his mother’s tradition and take the day with Camilla&nbsp;to reflect in solitude.”<span class="x_Apple-converted-space x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakoZ6ceqS0wKujnqtdnraqeceopaiqo2K5osDEZqiunZWjeqa4yLOYm52knXqqtYyopWaclZbBqXnAp6WirpWnwKK%2B2Gg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
