Shannon displayed that trait very pointedly this week.
But she was not the only one who wasn’t at her best.
Tamra lashed out at Shannon during a boat trip, yelling over her castmates, threatening Emily, and blasting Shannon’s drinking."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Not when you’re quibbling about hurting someone’s feelings.</p><p>Shannon says that she was there for Tamra. Tamra says that, ultimately, that stopped. The calls stopped.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0615_rhoc_04_tamrajudge-1024x576.png><p>Remember, Tamra wasn’t just dealing with the end of her time on Bravo. (Well, more of a hiatus, as we predicted at the time)</p><p>Her ex, Simon Barney, had just received a cancer diagnosis. Tamra said that Shannon abandoned her, when she offered support to Shannon for years.</p><p>“I remember when you and David were still married and you said, ‘David wants me to stop drinking,’ I said, ‘Then stop drinking,’” Tamra said. David Beador is Shannon’s ex.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0615_rhoc_16_shannonbeador-1024x576.png><p>This very visibly struck a nerve with Shannon.</p><p>She accused Tamra of “crossing a line” by even bringing this up.</p><p>Shannon will be the first to tell you that she doesn’t have a drinking problem. But not everyone would agree.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0615_rhoc_09-1024x576.png><p>While helping Eddie to dismantle their gym, Tamra shared the conversation with her husband.</p><p>“The only good thing out of the relationship was David, and I don’t even know how he lasted so long — she drinks way too much,” Eddie remarked.</p><p>Tamra commented that it was “funny” that he said that. Because, to hear Shannon tell it, her “drunken stupidness” only happened during her divorce from David. Is that so?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0615_rhoc_10_tamrajudge-1024x576.png><p>Tamra noticed that the pattern seemed to continue during and after Shannon’s relationship with John Janssen.</p><p>“After that it was, ‘John left me in New York, John left me at a restaurant,'” she cited.</p><p>Tamra characterized that “it’s always something. Always.” In other words, always an excuse.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0615_rhoc_11_emilysimpson_tamrajudge-1024x576.png><p>Gina Kirschenheiter couldn’t make it for her own boat trip, as she came down with COVID-19.</p><p>The other ladies had a blast … at the beginning.</p><p>But when Jennifer Pedranti began telling a recent story of adoption, one of her castmates found it impossible to pay attention.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0615_rhoc_12-1024x576.png><p>Shannon Beador began blurting out other things over her.</p><p>She excitedly pointed to someone on jet skis, wonder if it might be John’s son. And she pointed to a buoy where seals sometimes congregate … but not at tha ttime.</p><p>That can be sort of silly at times. But given the story that Jenn had been trying to share, it felt hurtful. Tamra noted that this is just who Shannon is — selfish.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0615_rhoc_13_tamrajudge-1024x576.png><p>With what appears to have been a few drinks in her, Tamra chatted with Heather Beador and Emily Simpson.</p><p>Both of these women are closer with Shannon than they once were. And both are team Reconciliation.</p><p>But Tamra wasn’t sure if there was anything left in Shannon that could offer her a friendship on equal footing. Oh, and she said that Shannon could “f–k a duck.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0615_rhoc_14_emilysimpson_shannonbeador-1024x576.png><p>It fell to Emily to let Shannon know that she had interrupted and spoken over their castmate.</p><p>Again, as Jenn said, it’s not like it was an anecdote about shopping for clothes. Other castmates like Heather and Emily had paid direct attention, while Shannon chattered about marine life.</p><p>To her credit, Shannon did acknowledge it. Which was great. And then Tamra joined them at the table.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0615_rhoc_15_tamrajudge-1024x576.png><p>There is a time and a place to suggest that someone has a drinking problem.</p><p>That time is probably not when you yourself are belligerent and perhaps intoxicated.</p><p>“F–k you and your f–king drinking, you alcoholic,” Tamra spat at Shannon. It was largely unprompted, but Tamra had been building up to this all day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0615_rhoc_16_emilysimpson_shannonbeador-1024x576.png><p>Emily wanted to make peace, but Tamra lashed out at her with an insincere threat to “hurt her.”</p><p>“Let’s talk about who’s coming unhinged,” Shannon suggested.</p><p>Tamra was not presenting herself well, and seemingly no one could stop her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0615_rhoc_17_tamrajudge-1024x576.png><p>“You can say whatever you want, Shannon, you’re a f–king liar, and you’re a drunk,” Tamra exclaimed.</p><p>Fortunately, she did not actually jump off of the boat. She did threaten to.</p><p>Shannon had behaved so poorly before this … if Tamra had a little more self-control, she could have come out on top during this boat ride.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2WDcMDApqmaZZqqsaixjJysq6uVqHqwwdNmmKWbn528rbXCZqqhmZ6jvK95wZ6YnaeiYrG2vsinnmaslaPApnnBqJitZaKesaZ7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
