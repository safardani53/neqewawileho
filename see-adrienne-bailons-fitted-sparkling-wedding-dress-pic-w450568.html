Ballon took <b>Loni Love</b>, <b>Jeannie Mai</b> and <b>Tamera Mowry</b> with her to the Ryan & Walter Bridal showroom in Los Angeles, where she tried on the strapless mermaid creation with a 10-foot French lace train that extended to 20 feet during the ceremony, according to <i>The Daily Mail.</i></p><p>“I’m trying to see myself in his eyes,” Bailon said through tears during her fitting, in an Instagram clip posted on November 13. “I think he would say I look good!”</p><p>The blushing bride-to-be revealed that she was worried about one aspect of the stunning number. “My boobs look really big,” she noted. “How are we going to make them not so big? We’re going to tape them down.” But that didn’t distract from the overall moment at all. “I could not dream of a more perfect dress,” she gushed.</p><p>Other intimate moments on the show include the couple’s first dance and them tasting their cake, as well as details on another kind of treat after the wedding. “We finally, finally, finally went upstairs,” Houghton revealed in a November 15 clip, mentioning that the couple had been abstaining from sex prior to then. “When I opened the door, I saw these gigantic portraits all over the suite of this beautiful woman not wearing much at all. It was inspirational, to say the least!”</p><p>Ballon and Houghton, 45, announced their engagement in August 2016. He popped the question in front of the Eiffel Tower, presenting his love with a massive, glittering engagement ring. Paris is where Bailon drew inspiration for her October bridal shower, thrown by her sister, <b>Claudette Bailon</b>.&nbsp;</p><p>“I choose you. And I'll choose you over and over and over,” Bailon captioned an October 11 shot from the couple’s co-ed wedding shower in Los Angeles. “Without pause, without a doubt, in a heartbeat. I'll keep choosing you.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6iypnnAnaminZ6jsm6uwKKjqKajYrOqwNOem2aroJa%2FrLjIp55mr5WZsaq6xmabq52jqHqxtcJmrm1tYGqDeXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
