John Cena has a pretty stellar record as a pro-wrestler, but that doesn’t mean he opts not to rely on some odd rituals before entering the ring.
During a recent appearance on The Kelly Clarkson Show, Cena, 42, opened up about his “nervous superstition” involving Tic Tacs, which he feels boosts his chances of a win. As the Massachusetts native explained, he has been known to ingest “pretty much 10,000 calories in straight sugar” by eating hundreds of the breath mints prior to a big match."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In September 2018, Cena <a href=#>professed his love</a> for Lao Gan Ma chili sauce, a spicy Chinese condiment. “I’m currently shooting a movie and I’m on a break and having a meal. I cannot use my mobile phone during filming so I’m now filming this (video) because they gave me Lao Gan Ma,” he told his fans in Mandarin via the Weibo app, at the time. “I am not familiar with Lao Gan Ma, but the Chinese say this is an excellent chili sauce. So now I use Lao Gan Ma every day on my broccoli.”</p><p>The athlete later added of the sauce: “[It’s] really, really good. I really like it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZqOnmKN6pLHNmmSemaSoenJ8j2lnZpuRobyztcSsZKKmXam2pHnTmpqsZZKas7C%2BxGaYZp6ZnLW1ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
