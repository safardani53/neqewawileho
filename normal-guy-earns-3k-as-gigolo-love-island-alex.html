But Seb Wright, 29, who admits he is just an ordinary guy, is raking in up to £3,000 a weekas an escort.
Seb, who also works as a furniture designer, is among a growing number of young men touting their “services” online.
After we revealed Love Island Essex boy Alex Miller, 28, previously charged £50 an hour through online agency Gentlemen4Hire, it seems being a gigolo is becoming more common."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Before I did this, I pictured that everybody is looking for this James Bond-esque, super suave, ripped guy but that’s not the case at all.</p><p>“I’m just a normal guy, but if I said yes to every phone call I got I’d be working all the time. It has boosted my confidence doing this, for sure.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000418943256.jpg><p>He charges £80 per hour and £500 for an overnight “job”. His clients are typically older than him, usually ranging in age from 30 to 50 but sometimes older.</p><p>He says: “Some just want someone they can relax with, that makes them feel comfortable and feel good. And certainly, the younger guy thing appeals to some. I think it makes some feel young and sexy.”</p><p>Seb admits he doesn’t have a specific age limit. He says: “If I met a woman who is 50, but she looks good, she’s intelligent and we click really well, what does her age matter?”</p><p>His clients tend to fall into two categories — divorcees looking for a night of passion or single professionals who are simply too busy to look for relationships.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT0004164922023.jpg><p>Seb says: “With divorcees, they don’t want to go back on the dating scene yet. They just want to be in the situation where they can be clear about what they want and focus on having a good time. A woman still has needs.</p><p>“Then there are women in demanding jobs who don’t have the time to meet guys.”</p><p>Seb, who lives in the South East, says he often gets asked to fulfil women’s fantasies, which they are “too shy” to share with other men.</p><p>He says: “I have one client who is a strong woman but had had a difficult time with her previous partner. After spending time with me, her fantasies have come out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT0004164921991.jpg><p>“She has let go of all her inhibitions. The little devil has come out of her.</p><p>“She has bought sex toys, has talked about getting another girl involved and other more unusual practices.</p><p>“She was with an older guy before. Being with a younger guy, I guess she’s able to feel a bit younger too.</p><p>“A female CEO has asked me to dress up as a personal trainer and wants to be dominated.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AF-GRAPHIC-CHARGE-RATE.jpg><p>“We’ve not met yet but I’ve had to write up a mock job application and send it to her. She’s asked me to send her pictures of myself in a tracksuit.</p><p>“She wants me to stick my socks in her mouth. It’s quite unusual. I’ve turned down jobs, including one woman who was into feet. She wanted to hold mine. It seems to be a thing.</p><p>“The job has opened my eyes.”</p><p>Single Seb became an escort after a friend recommended he give it a go.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000418942510.jpg><p>He says: “I was guilty of being a bit of a serial dater before and I was out of work for a bit so it made sense.</p><p>“I don’t work nine-to-five hours making furniture and it seemed a good opportunity that would conveniently fit into my schedule.</p><p>“I didn’t tell my mum until I was making what is considered a living.</p><p>“I knew she’d be shocked but, when I explained how it worked and that escorting isn’t prostitution — as is usually misconceived — she was supportive.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000418942949.jpg><p>In the past six months, Seb has built up several satisfied regulars.</p><p>He says: “Most of my work comes from repeat clients. I’m lucky I can pick and choose. I speak to them a bit before I meet them and decide which ones I can get on with.</p><p>“I don’t turn up and sleep with a girl that night. Good sex begins in the mind. If she’s intelligent then we’re off to a good start. It’s yet another reason why getting to know clients before meeting is my preferred approach.”</p><p>Women aren’t always looking for a night of lust — with some paying the full fee just to have a companion for the night.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN FABULOUS</h2></p><p>Seb says: “I charge per hour, so what we do in that time is up to the client and me. I saw a regular recently and we didn’t have sex. We went out for dinner and just talked.</p><p>“I’ve had enquiries from women who want to book me for a wedding they’re attending and pretend to be their boyfriend.”</p><p>And Seb isn’t looking to give this business up any time soon. He says: “My normal dating has been sidelined. I’m sure at some point I’ll go back on the relationship scene, but not just yet.”</p><ul><li><strong>Seb Wright is an alias.</strong></li></ul><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Trisha admits she used to escort for seven years during heart to heart with Jemma Lucy on Celebrity Big Brother</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5VxaGxtZ218r7vRppilZZeqxm6xwKulrGVjoHqiv4ygoKCnnKR6rbvVnmSiq5yWu6V5wKWcsWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
