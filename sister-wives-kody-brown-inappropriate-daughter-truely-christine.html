He doesn't appreciate <a href=#>the way that Kody treated Christine</a>.</p><p>"He thinks he treated her terrible," the insider noted.</p><p>"David's really chivalrous to Christine and truly <a href=#>treats her like a queen</a>.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>"He wines and dines her and takes her to nice restaurants.</p><p>"He <a href=#>brings her on trips</a> to, like, Universal Studios and Disneyland because that's where she always wanted desperately to go for family time but Kody never would go."</p><p>The source continued: "All these things they are doing are things that she always wanted Kody to go and do and he never made time for.</p><p>"So she's kind of reliving all the years of her failed marriage through David."</p><h2>'HEARTBROKEN' & 'BOTHERED'</h2><p>Both David and Christine have flaunted their <a href=#>relationship</a> on social media - ever since going public in February - and gushed how <a href=#>"blessed"</a> they are to have one another.</p><p>There is <a href=#>no shortage of new memories</a> they are creating together and, of course, sharing along with Sister Wives fans.</p><p>Fans have even suggested the mom of six was throwing <a href=#>subtle shade at her ex</a>.</p><p>The source added: "A lot of their posts are digs at Kody. A lot of the stuff they're doing is with intention. It's really calculated."</p><p>Not only does the father of 18 find it "inappropriate" about his daughter's living situation, he also finds Truely's relationship with her soon-to-be father-in-law "bothersome."</p><p>A source previously told The U.S. Sun: "Kody seeing photos of his daughter with&nbsp;David&nbsp;is <a href=#>really bothersome to him</a>. It's triggering.</p><p>"Truely is a daddy's girl and always was. The whole situation with Kody is heartbreaking."</p><h2><strong>CUSTODY BATTLE</strong></h2><p>Christine and Kody last left off, per the show, disputing custody of their daughter as the Plexus ambassador prepared for her move from&nbsp;<a href=#>Arizona</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=#>Utah</a>.</p><p>The TLC star made the&nbsp;<a href=#>move in the fall of 2021</a>, shortly before publicly&nbsp;<a href=#>announcing her split</a>&nbsp;from Kody.</p><p><a href=#>Robyn Brown</a>'s husband shared his point of view in an&nbsp;October 2022 episode.</p><p>"You can’t take her from me because we’ll have to have a shared custody. It’ll have to be 50/50.</p><p>"I’m going to have to <a href=#>be involved in Truely’s life</a>. And you can’t actually stop me from being in her life.</p><p>"So I don’t know what your intention was with moving with her," Kody said at the time.</p><p>During his confessional, Kody detailed his objections: "The whole issue is, from the beginning of this, she didn’t ask me if it was ok if she moved to Utah and took Truely.</p><p>"She just told me she was going to do it."</p><p>In her own confessional, Christine exploded: "I find it ironic that now he wants to be involved in my kid’s lives.&nbsp;Now that I’m leaving.</p><p>"Now he wants 50/50 time with them? Well hell, he could have had 50/50 time with us the whole f**king time we lived here.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"If he wanted 50/50 he should have been around more.
