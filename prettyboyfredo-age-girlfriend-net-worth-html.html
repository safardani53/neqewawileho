His channel features a mix of pranks, challenges, vlogs, and various types of&nbsp;NBA 2K gaming&nbsp;videos that have earned him more than 7 million subscribers till December 2020.</p><p>He also co-owns another YouTube channel named <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The 2x family</a>, which was created in December 2017. That channel has over 2.8 million subscribers.</p><h2>Prettyboyfredo's Bio: Real Name, Age, Height, Difficult Upbringing Discussed</h2><p>Although Prettyboyfredo is very popular with his online name, his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">real name</a> or birth name is&nbsp;Alfredo Villa. He was&nbsp;born on August 20, 1993, in Palm Beach, Florida, USA. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The recognized YouTuber grew up under&nbsp;difficult circumstances—his mother was a drug addict, and his father was an illegal immigrant from Costa Rica.</p><p>When Prettyboyfredo was three months old, he and his siblings were&nbsp;given up by his parents, and later, they were placed in a group home. Sadly, they got split up and&nbsp;were put into foster care.&nbsp;He bounced from home to home and had nothing neither&nbsp;a sense of belonging nor a purpose in life.</p><p>He grew up in despair without ever knowing the taste of love, hope, and support from anyone that he could call his own. He was all alone in this universe of over seven billion humans. The pain left him questioning his existence—it moved him to wonder why people were meant to live a life like his. He didn’t know the answer, he didn’t understand, and so he grew up to be an angry kid. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The void that his parents left in him was like a black hole sucking him empty from the inside. No family from a foster home could ever fill that void, in fact, no one tried.</p><p>Alfredo opened up about his difficult childhood in his YouTube&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">video</a> in 2017, where he teared up and claimed that he had no one to call a family, and he felt lost.&nbsp;Fortunately, his perspective on life changed after he found love from a number of people and also his adoptive family, leading him to become a very humble and grateful man.</p><h2>How Much Is Prettyboyfredo's Net Worth?</h2><p>Coming from a difficult childhood,&nbsp;Alfredo Villa a.k.a. Prettyboyfredo made his life big with a career on YouTube. Today, his estimated net worth is in millions, although he has not disclosed his exact net worth figures.</p><p>In 2020, however, he purchased a new&nbsp;mansion worth&nbsp;5 million dollars and disclosed the details with a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">house</a> tour video on YouTube. The house is equipped with&nbsp;an indoor basketball court, bowling alley, movie theater and so much more. The house was bought for his squad named SSH (Savage Squad Hoppers).</p><h2>Prettyboyfredo Is Father To A Daughter Named&nbsp;Ava Jade</h2><p>The 27-years-old YouTuber is a father to a daughter named&nbsp;Ava Jade. He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">welcomed</a> the baby girl with&nbsp;Jasmine Jade on November 11, 2017. At that time,&nbsp;Prettyboyfredo and&nbsp;Jasmine were only in a relationship—they were not married.</p><p>Prettyboyfredo's daughter&nbsp;Ava also has an Instagram account, managed by her father&nbsp;Prettyboyfredo and mother&nbsp;Jasmine. Her account's user name is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@prettygirlava</a>&nbsp;and it has over 420 thousand followers. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>On November 11, 2020, Ava <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">celebrated</a> her 3rd birthday. On the occasion,&nbsp;Jasmine posted birthday celebration pictures clicked with a little birthday girl along with a heartwarming caption.</p><p>Happy 3rd Birthday to the most smart, caring, beautiful, funny, and loving little girl. You give my life so much meaning and purpose, everything I do is for you, I love you so much Ava Jade, always & forever..</p><h2>Prettyboyfredo And&nbsp;Jasmine Has Been Together Through Thick and Thins Since 2013</h2><p>Alfredo and Jasmine started dating each other in 2013. Since then, the couple has been&nbsp;together through thick and thins and experienced a great deal, including running a collaborative YouTube channel named&nbsp;The 2x Family, welcoming&nbsp;their first child together, getting engaged, and a short-time breakup in 2019.</p><p>Speaking about the birth of their child, they welcomed&nbsp;a baby girl Ava into their life on November 11, 2017, and embraced parenthood with open arms. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-623 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After a year, on November 5, 2020,&nbsp;Prettyboyfredo got down on his knees, offered an engagement ring, and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">proposed</a> to Jasmine for marriage. In reply, Jasmine emotionally accepted the proposal.</p><p>However, the relationship saw its dip when the two had to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">break up</a> due to personal reasons in mid-2019. But the two addressed their mistakes sometime later so that they can get back together. And indeed they cleared the air between them and happily <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">accepted</a> each other.</p><p>Presently, both&nbsp;Prettyboyfredo and&nbsp;Jasmine are living together as partners and parenting their daughter Ava. As for when the wedding bell will toll, the pair have remained silent as of now. But it could only be a matter of time before we get to see the newlyweds. We could see a lavish wedding where their little bundle of joy Ava could be by her mother's side as a bridesmaid. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6W%2FpsDTspmosZansqW7jJqenmWXnr%2BtstGinKecXaOytXnWqKmtoF6dwa64</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
