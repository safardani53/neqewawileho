The “Since U Been Gone” singer, 41, admitted that she’s still single during an Instagram Live back in September 2023, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>.&nbsp;When a fan asked about any potential romances, Kelly said she wasn’t seeing anyone, but she was loving the single life. “Do I have a boyfriend? No! And not looking. You know why? I <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>love being single,</a>” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Prior to her 2020 divorce, Kelly was in a long-term relationship with Brandon, whom she’d been dating since 2013. The pair had a long legal battle following their split, and most recently, Brandon has been ordered to pay the&nbsp;American Idol&nbsp;alum for contract deals organized on his behalf. About three years after the pair called it quits, take a look back on their relationship and find out everything you need to know about their divorce.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/kelly-clarkson-husband-embed.jpg><h2>How Did Kelly Meet Brandon?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>While Kelly and Brandon didn’t start dating until 2013, they actually met back in 2006, when she was performing at the Academy of Country Music Awards, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>.&nbsp;At the time, Brandon was married, but the “Because of You” singer ran into him again in February 2012 at the Super Bowl. At the time, Brandon’s dad <strong>Narvel Blackstock&nbsp;</strong>was Kelly’s manager. They had their first date a week later, and they instantly connected.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The pair got engaged in December of that year, and they tied the knot in October 2013.</p><h2>Brandon Is a Talent Manager</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Like his dad, Brandon is also a talent manager. After they got together, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Brandon</a> took over as his wife’s manager. Unfortunately, when the pair got divorced, there was some debate over his management fees. Kelly had claimed that he defrauded her by charging large fees.</p><h2>Kelly and Brandon Share 2 Kids</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>During their marriage, Kelly and Brandon raised two children together. Their first daughter&nbsp;<strong>River Rose,&nbsp;</strong>9, was born in June 2014, and their son&nbsp;<strong>Remington “Remy,”&nbsp;</strong>7, was born in April 2016. Back in March 2023, the talk show host admitted that her children <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>were both very sad</a> about their split. “I literally ask my kids every night when we’re snuggling, ‘Are you happy? And if you’re not, what could make you happier?’” she said on the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Angie Martinez IRL&nbsp;</a>podcast. “A&nbsp;lot of times it would be like, ‘You know,<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> I’m just really sad.</a> I wish Mommy and Daddy were in the same house.’ And they’re really honest about it. And I’m raising that kind of individual.”</p><h2>Kelly Filed for Divorce in 2020</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>After seven years of marriage, the singer<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> filed for divorce</a> from her husband in June 2020. Following the split, the couple had a major legal battle about splitting their belongings and custody of their two kids. They <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>reached a settlement</a> in March 2022.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Following a legal battle, Brandon was ordered to pay over $2.6 million to Kelly for business deals that he set up when he shouldn’t have, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>.&nbsp;The legal filing said he overstepped his boundaries as a manager to procure deals with The Voice, The Kelly Clarkson Show,&nbsp;the&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;Music Awards, Norwegian Cruise Lines, and Wayfair. The court found that he didn’t overstep for her talk show, but did for the others, and he was ordered to pay back the fees. His team has filed an appeal.</p><h2>Kelly’s Album ‘Chemistry’ Was Inspired by the Split</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Following the split, Kelly released<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> the holiday album</a>&nbsp;When Christmas Comes Around&nbsp;in 2021, and it had a great breakup song called “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Christmas Isn’t Canceled (Just You).”</a> Fans did pick up on some things, like a lyric change in a cover of <strong>Billie Eilish’s </strong>“Happier Than Ever,” thinking that they were references to the divorce. Her&nbsp; first non-holiday album Chemistry&nbsp;was released in June 2023, and contained quite a few songs that <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>seemed inspired by the split</a>, like the track “Mine.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8qeo6WxXZi5or7KrKanZZiqwKOtzZ1kbmpgaYR6gY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
