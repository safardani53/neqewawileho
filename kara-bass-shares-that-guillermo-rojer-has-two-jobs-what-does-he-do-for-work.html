They clearly love each other. And they are expecting their first child.</p><p>But at the Tell All, Kara admitted that there was some tension when she was their little family’s sole provider.</p><p>Guillermo is working now. And Kara just shared what he’s doing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Like Thais Ramone, Kara Bass was pregnant at the Tell All special, which filmed in June and aired in August.</p><p>Both women are due in November.</p><p>Guillermo is a bit young for fatherhood (or, under most circumstances, for marriage), but he is clearly excited.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>In fact, Kara shared that their sex life has actually improved since the pregnancy news.</p><p>That might not end up being the case after they welcome their baby — and we don’t just mean while she heals.</p><p>Having a newborn is a total life-changer. They will have less time for everything else, especially when work is still a factor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Kara held a recent impromptu Q&A on Instagram so that her followers could ask her just about anything.</p><p>“What does your husband do for a living?” one asked, knowing that Guillermo is now working.</p><p>Kara was clearly delighted to announce: “Right now he has 2 jobs.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>(This screenshot doesn’t really add anything to what Kara had to say, but you’re welcome anyway)</p><p>Kara offered few details — which is smart. Even if no “crazed” fans show up at his job, just a handful of haters could call in and sabotage him if they wanted.</p><p>She did share that Guillermo is working in “sales” and that he is also working in “hospitality.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Kara’s sparkly emoji use made it clear that she is very proud of Guillermo. We all are, really.</p><p>Obviously, his job could be anything from running a bread and breakfast to leaving mints on pillows at hotels.</p><p>But it’s probably somewhere in between. Over time, Guillermo will build up a work history in the US and his prospects will grow.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Speaking of growing, Kara of course remains pregnant, and fans asked about that.</p><p>One asked about her due date.</p><p>Kara detailed that their baby is due on November 27. That is the Sunday after Thanksgiving. Sounds like Kara and Guillermo might miss Cyber Monday.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Obviously, we’re talking about a 90 Day Fiance couple here. Not every part of their season was filled with joy.</p><p>In fact, Kara received something of a villain edit, if not as severely as castmate Emily Bieberly. (Viewers seemed to warm to both of them at the Tell All)</p><p>Kara was sometimes pretty blunt with Guillermo. She also gave the impression that she treated him “like a child,” indicating a lack of trust or respect.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Certainly, there were times when Kara could and even should have made decisions with Guillermo instead of unilaterally.</p><p>Whether or not the “laptop” dispute was real, just because she was paying the bills and doing the driving didn’t mean that Guillermo shouldn’t get a say.</p><p>Being a couple is about a partnership, no matter who is doing what. We hope that she and Guillermo both fully understand this.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Their season also saw sad moments, like Guillermo’s brother’s health struggle and then tragic death.</p><p>They both wished that he had been able to attend their wedding, even remotely, with other family members.</p><p>That tragedy did lead to them expanding their wedding plans, putting more money into the ceremony as a tribute to Jose Joaquin.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>We continue to wish these two well.</p><p>And, when Guillermo is in a place where he is ready to share more about his work, we look forward to hearing from him.</p><p>In the mean time, November will be here sooner than we think.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2WGcLfAq5hmmpGowG6%2Fx5qpnqtdqbWiwIygrKKknJq%2FrruMq6ajnaJitaK%2FjK2uqGWapK%2B0edahmK1llKSytHnHnmSdp12bvLN51qippGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
