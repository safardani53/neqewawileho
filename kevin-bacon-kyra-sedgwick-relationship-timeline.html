Although Bacon doesn't remember the interaction, it was the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>first time he met his now-wife</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-1987-kevin-bacon-and-kyra-sedgwick-fall-in-love-while-filming-lemon-sky></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>1987: Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick fall in love while filming Lemon Sky</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Frank Micelotta/ImageDirect</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bacon and Sedgwick formally met on the set of 1988's Lemon Sky. As Sedgwick later <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>recalled</a> on Conan, Bacon organized (and paid for) group dinners for the entire cast, hoping she would come along. When she didn't, he recommended that she get a massage at his hotel.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sedgwick explained that Bacon told her that the hotel's gym was next to the massage room, and if he wrapped up his workout around when her massage ended, they should grab dinner after.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"And I'm thinking, 'Yeah sure, that's not going to happen.

"When I did fall in love with Kevin, it really just felt like there was some urgency to get married, and I don't know what it was. Suddenly this thing came over me and I was terrified," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>she told Vulture</a> in 2019.
