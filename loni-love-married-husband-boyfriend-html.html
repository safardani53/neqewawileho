Her witty commentary and outgoing personality turned her into a fan favorite overnight upon its airing.

The syndicated talk show, which is known for following the lives of its hosts, was announced to run for two more seasons in 2018.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The comedian/actress&nbsp;has also become quite infamous for her stance on marriage. She had mentioned that she was happy&nbsp;to be a 'satisfied single' in many of her interviews. Funnily enough,&nbsp;this was&nbsp;never the case. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Nor is&nbsp;this&nbsp;true for her now. Unbeknownst to many of her fans, she was actually married a long-time back. This was revealed by Love herself in her Twitter handle. After her divorce, she stands by decision to stay unmarried but this certainly did not mean that she was not single and ready to mingle.&nbsp;</p><p>2 years back, Love hit her fans with another curve ball by making her boyfriend public, which also turned heads and caused controversy.&nbsp;</p><h2>Loni Love Revealed She Was Once Married. Chose Marriage Over Career Instead.&nbsp;</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In September 2015, Loni confessed that she was once married using the hashtag <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">BeingLoniLove</a> via Twitter. The revelation was a total surprise for the people who hadn't read her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">2013 book</a>, Love Him Or Leave Him where she had also revealed about her married life.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Later, in 2016, she again stated via Twitter that she was married but followed that up with the hashtag <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">DealBreakerIn3Words</a>, implying that her marriage was a deal-breaker for her.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Love has become vocal about her failed marriage since early on. After the release of her book in 2013, she also went <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">public</a> about her failed marriage in The Real Daytime Show.&nbsp;</p><p>In the show, Love said that she knew what the married hosts were talking about when they were talking about marriages. She then went on to divulge further details about her ex, who she mentioned&nbsp;as a 'fine' man. They dated for two years before he asked her to marry him in Vegas.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>According to her, the initial days of her marriage were blissful, which wasn't the case as time passed by. She realized that she was really young in comedy and protecting her marriage would sacrifice her growth in her career.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>She faced the same dilemma with an&nbsp;ex-boyfriend she had faced years ago when she left her engineering career. So, this time around, she&nbsp;chose her career over her husband. That was the furthest&nbsp;that the Real Talk Show host cared to divulge about her marriage and left it at that.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Regardless, that a long time back and Loni Love certainly seems to have&nbsp;put herself back in the dating game.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Love Feels No Need To Get Married. Enjoying Unmarried Life With Boyfriend</h2><p>The stand-up is currently dating actor James Welsh. Love revealed her new boyfriend’s identity in an Instagram post dated <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">December 5</a>, 2015. That date was not just any date for Love, it was, as she posted herself, their 10th date.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Love didn’t just stop there. She took her newfound love-interest and showed him off any chance she could get. She then&nbsp;hit with another post in December 29, and this time it was of her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">vacation</a> with her new paramour.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Just recently, they celebrated Welsch’s <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">birthday</a> together and Love even made her put on a birthday hat.&nbsp;Although Loni revealed her new man to the public, she hasn’t disclosed any further info on their relationship like 'how they met?" and so on.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But luckily some fragments of their relationship were revealed during <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">RuPaul&nbsp;Show</a> when the new couple themselves appeared to talk the details of how they had met and what was it like to be a famous interracial couple.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>The Real Loni Love</h2><p>Loni's comedic career didn’t take off until 2004 when she appeared on the singing show <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Star Search</a>. Since then, she has gone on to feature in films and on many television shows. Her movie catalog includes Soul Plane&nbsp;(2004),&nbsp;Bad Asses (2014),&nbsp;and Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 (2015).&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>However, she has been doing stand-up comedy since her time at Prairie View A&M University, where she first discovered her comedic prowess winning a $50 dollar <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">competition</a>.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The engineer-turned-comedian left a more significant <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">mark</a> on TV, starting from her 2003 appearances in VH1’s I Love the 80’s Strikes Back. Besides these, she has also covered for CNN.
