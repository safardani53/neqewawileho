It's not you, it's them.</h2><p>If you are currently seeing old videos on your FYP and you've already refreshed your FYP by dragging down on a video, it means that there is something wrong with TikTok's algorithm. It is likely a bug or a glitch.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>You see, TikTok's algorithm, which is uniquely tailored to each user, determines what videos will show up on one's FYP. It aims to show users the most relevant and up-to-date videos based on their interests and past viewing history. But as I'm sure we all know, algorithms are imperfect and things can occasionally go awry.</p><p>So if you're seeing really old videos on TikTok, know that there is definitely something wrong. TikTok wouldn't just show you old videos like that unless its team was having technical difficulties internally.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>My TikTok fyp is broken today.

Many creators took to Twitter to discuss this strange occurrence. By typing in keywords like "TikTok" and "old videos" into the Twitter search bar, you can look for tweets on that subject. And usually, when there is a big glitch or outage, there is no shortage of users complaining on Twitter.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>anyone else‚Äôs tiktok giving them old videos they‚Äôve seen already from like september-december of 2022?? i‚Äôm so confused as to why it‚Äôs happening</p>‚Äî break the raccoon üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà (@instrumentalwat) <a href=#>June 12, 2023</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>my tiktok been messing up showing old videos for a week now. i‚Äôm bout to go crazy without it üò≠</p>‚Äî Tionaaü´∂üèΩ (@TionaTakia) <a href=#>June 15, 2023</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>IS TIKTOK BROKEN AND NOT LOADING VIDS OR IS IT JUST ME</p>‚Äî paigeüåüüíãiso eras cincy!

For example, the platform did not acknowledge the June 12, 2023 incident. In fact, the brand's support Twitter account, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@TikTokSupport</a>, looks like it hasn't even been active since 2021.</p><p>In cases like this, the best thing you can do is wait it out. Because even though TikTok might not have addressed the situation publicly, they are likely well aware of the issue and probably have a lot of people breathing down their necks until they get it fixed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecisZK2hm6m8rHnSoaawoZ6ceq6xjKijnWWmnrGmu9I%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
