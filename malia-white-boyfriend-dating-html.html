Chief stew Katie Flood replied with a fire emoji. At the same time, stewardess Courtney Veale, who seemed overly excited about&nbsp;the PDA photo, commented&nbsp;that Baker “broke the internet” and added an “OMG” alongside&nbsp;some fire emojis. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Last month, Baker posted a birthday tribute for White on Instagram&nbsp;and noted that he loved her in the caption. However, White has not posted any photos of her with her rumored new beau on her account yet.&nbsp;</p><p>White’s new official relationship comes after her breakup with her ex-boyfriend Tom Checketts, a chef on the show.&nbsp;</p><h2>Break up With Tom Checketts</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In September 2020, White confirmed that she and Checketts had broken up after more than a year of dating. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The reality star took to her Instagram to clarify the status of her relationship with Checketts, noting that since everyone was talking about it,&nbsp;she'd rather her fans heard from her than others.&nbsp;</p><p>She revealed she had split with Checketts and added that the reason behind it was something she wanted to keep private out of respect for him. The breakup was a surprise to many fans who saw how close they were throughout Season 5.&nbsp;</p><p>During&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">part 2 of the season 5 reunion</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, White&nbsp;revealed she didn’t know their relationship status. However, when asked if she regretted her relationship with Checketts, she shared it was nice to have him there.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Similarly, Checketts explained they were both so busy, they had not seen each other for a few months. However, he added they were still trying to make the relationship work.&nbsp;</p><h2>Cheating Scandal</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Although White did not reveal the cause of their breakup, she divulged the true reason a year after&nbsp;their split.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>During an&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">episode on season 6</a>&nbsp;of the show, White seemed annoyed at getting a phone call from Checketts until she dropped&nbsp;a major&nbsp;bomb. In&nbsp;the confessional, she explained that she hated him and that were plenty of fishes in the sea, particularly ones that “don’t sleep with other fishes.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Shortly after, she&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">opened up to Us Weekly</a>&nbsp;about the things that happened between the two of them.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>&nbsp;We were working on different boats. So, it was impossible for us to see each other. And, yeah, he found someone else on his boats, and I didn’t know for a couple of months.</p><p>She added she found out about his cheating “through a friend” before “all hell broke loose” between them. She also noted that Checketts was really sorry and wanted to get back together, but she was not interested.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKWRobaiedahoK2dXZe8urLRopynnF2ZrrW1zaBloaydoQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
