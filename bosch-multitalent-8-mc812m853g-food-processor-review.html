You can use it on everything from smaller quantities of vegetables for sauces to hard cheeses and meat but, despite its shape, you can’t use it on things like coffee beans or spices.</p><p>The one issue we found was that there were no markers for the maximum amount of food you can add.</p><p>We found it will snugly fit the contents of a 400g can of chickpeas but we had to start and stop the machine several times to make sure it was blending evenly - we did get very smooth hummus at the end of it, though.</p><p>The blades in the mini chopper are integrated, which means cleaning under them can be a bit of a pain. You can "pre-clean" it using the machine by adding water and a little bit of washing up liquid and switching it on for a few seconds.</p><p>Finally, there’s the 1.5l blender, which is suitable for hot or cold ingredients, making it great for ice cold frappes or piping hot soups.</p><p>We used it to make smoothies with a mix of frozen and fresh ingredients and the results were smooth and silky every time.</p><h2>Bosch MultiTalent 8 MC812M853G food processor: Is it good for slicing and grating?</h2><p>The Bosch MultiTalent 8 MC812M853G food processor comes with three discs: reversible thick/thin slicer, reversible coarse/fine grater and a julienne disc.</p><p>This function took a while to set up - you have to install the attachment, the nest for the discs and then the disc itself - but once that’s all done, it was easy to use.</p><p>We found that the slicer and grater discs powered through vegetables very quickly and produced nice, even results, even on harder vegetables like carrots.</p><p>For those who love cooking stir fry, the julienne disc will be a welcome addition. It managed to cut carrots into perfect matchsticks in just a matter of seconds, saving valuable time and effort.</p><ul><li><strong>Bosch MultiTalent 8 MC812M853G, for £229 from AO.com - <a href=#>buy here</a></strong></li></ul><h2>Bosch MultiTalent 8 MC812M853G food processor: Is it good for kneading dough?</h2><p>The Bosch MultiTalent 8 MC812M853G food processor comes with a metal dough hook, which can be used to work harder doughs.</p><p>We tested a brioche recipe on it, which is a wetter dough, and it brought the ingredients together very quickly.</p><p>However, because the dough hook only rotates in a circular motion rather than a planetary one like bigger stand mixers, we found that the dough tended to stick to the middle rather than move around.</p><p>So while all the ingredients were combined, the dough wasn’t being worked enough to help the gluten develop.</p><p>It meant that the dough had to be kneaded by hand for a bit after it’s removed from the machine.</p><p>You also have to add all the ingredients when the bowl is already docked, which can get messy.</p><h2>Bosch MultiTalent 8 MC812M853G food processor: the other accessories<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/81i-AZOixZL._AC_SL1500_.jpg></h2><p>The Bosch MultiTalent 8 MC812M853G food processor also comes with a juicing attachment and a whisk.</p><p>The juicer was pretty straightforward - the conical reamer forces the juice out from any citrus fruits you use while a strainer catches any stray pips.</p><p>We found that the whisk was really efficient at everything from making batter to whisking egg whites as it rotates on an axis while rotating around the bowl.</p><p>If you are making batter though, you will need to stop the machine to scrape down the sides and corners to make sure everything is mixed in.</p><ul><li><strong>Bosch MultiTalent 8 MC812M853G, for £229 from AO.com - <a href=#>buy here</a></strong></li></ul><h2>Bosch MultiTalent 8 MC812M853G food processor: the verdict</h2><p>Overall, we really liked how fast and efficient the Bosch MultiTalent 8 MC812M853G food processor was.</p><p>Its best features are the slicing/grating/julienne discs as they produced consistent results every time.</p><p>Our only gripe is that it takes longer to assemble than smaller machines and there are more bits to wash up - but if you don’t mind or have a dishwasher, this makes a great option for big families.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN SUN SELECTS</h2></p><p>If you're shopping around for a food processor, we've reviewed the <a href=#>Cuisinart 1.9l Easy Prep Pro</a> and <a href=#>KitchenAid 5KFP0719 1.7l food processor</a>.</p><p>We've also put the <a href=#>Ninja Foodi Mini 6-in-1 Multi-Cooker</a> to the test.</p><p>For more air fryer options, we've rounded up some of the <a href=#>best air fryers on the market</a>.</p><p>If you click a link in this article, we may earn affiliate revenue</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZmpsYWp%2BcX2YaJmoq5Odeq7By62grZmcmru1eZdmpJxwYWe6eYGSoGSfp5%2BZerG%2BzpycrKufp3qzsdWinLBn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
