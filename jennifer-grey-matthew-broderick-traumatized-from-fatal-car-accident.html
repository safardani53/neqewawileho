Being alone on a country road in the middle of nowhere with nobody else around or conscious was pretty terrifying … It led to so many other things in my life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Jennifer-Grey-Recalls-Traumatic-Car-Accident-With-Matthew-Broderick-That-Left-2-People-Dead-Inline.jpg><p>The crash, which occurred right <a href=#>before the release</a> of her 1987 film <a href=#>Dirty Dancing</a>, left two people dead and Broderick, 60, with severe injuries.</p><p>“I was the sole living witness because Matthew had survived, but he was unconscious and had amnesia and was very badly injured,” the actress revealed. “I thought he was dead. I didn’t even know there were two other women who were tragically killed at the time. It’s just something that you just don’t come back from in the same way.”</p><p>While Broderick was behind the wheel at the time, the <a href=#>Friends</a> alum told ET that no details were withheld about the accident — and The Producers star wasn’t to blame.</p><p>“I wasn’t holding any information that people seem to think I did because they wanted an answer and there was no answer because it was an accident,” she said. “And [Broderick]&nbsp;was a great driver, and nobody was drinking. It&nbsp;was just an accident. And it was tragic, and I think about the family in Ireland all the time.”</p><p>Grey&nbsp;and Broderick met on the set of Ferris Buellers Day Off. The former couple hid their relationship before getting engaged while the 1986 film was still in production. The two were together for 12 years before calling it quits in 1988.&nbsp;(Broderick moved on with <a href=#><strong>Sarah Jessica Parker</strong></a>, who he married in 1997).</p><p>Following her split from the Daybreak actor, the New York native was set up on a blind date with <a href=#><strong>Johnny Depp</strong></a>, who she referred to as “ridiculously beautiful” but “crazy jealous and paranoid” in her <a href=#>2022 memoir</a>.</p><p>“He’d started missing his flights home to LA having overslept or when he did come home, he’d be crazy jealous and paranoid about what I’d been up to while he was gone,” she wrote. “I attributed his ill temper and unhappiness to him feeling miserable and powerless to get off the [TV series] 21 Jump Street.”</p><p>The Red Dawn actress <a href=#>ended her relationship</a> with Depp, 58, just before her 29th birthday after he left for a meeting and engaged in what she described to be a “self-imposed streak of impulsive, destructive decision making.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Sweeney Todd star, who is currently in a defamation case again ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Amber Heard</strong></a>, moved on following his split from&nbsp;Grey&nbsp;to <a href=#><strong>Winona Ryder</strong></a>, who happened to be&nbsp;Grey’s neighbor at the time.</p><p>“It was the classic nightmare of feeling replaced, like you never happened, but on steroids,” the Dirty Dancing star said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajnZ6jtqex0Waeq52pYrqiwNOhnLBlkqe8pbHRopqkZaSnrra5wK2gs52UYrOzu8xmnZqskaF6pK3RZpicm5mZsq%2FAjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
