Renner, 52, took to Instagram on Friday, December 29, to tease the first song off the record.
“I know that I’m complicated / I don’t have a lot to say,” Renner sings, accompanying home video footage with his 10-year-old daughter, Ava. “Maybe I’m uncomfortable / Little unpredictable sometimes."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I hope I get the courage to share with you all.”</p><p class=p1>In January, Renner was <a href=#>hospitalized in “critical but stable condition”</a> after a snowplow accident. He suffered blunt chest trauma and orthopedic injuries, including 30 broken bones.</p><p class=p1>“I just happened to be the dummy standing on the dang track a little bit, seeing if my nephew was there. You shouldn’t be outside the vehicle when you’re operating it, you know what I mean? It’s like driving a car with one foot out of the car,” Renner told <strong>Diane Sawyer</strong> <a href=#>during an April interview</a>, recalling the incident. “But it is what it was. And it’s my mistake, and I paid for it.”</p><p class=p1>The Oscar nominee was afraid that the snowmobile would roll back and crush his nephew, Alex. When Renner attempted to disengage the vehicle, he accidentally got run over.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“I was awake through every moment. It’s exactly what you would imagine it would feel like,” he added at the time. “It is hard to imagine what that feels like, but when you look at the machine and you look at — I was on asphalt and ice. I wish I was on snow. It felt like someone took the wind out of you. Too many things are going on in the body to feel pain, it’s everything. It’s like if your soul could have pain.”</p><p class=p1>Following his months-long recovery, Renner <a href=#>returned to the red carpet</a> for the first time in April. He was all smiles with Ava, whom he shares with ex-wife <strong>Sonni Pacheco</strong>, at the premiere of his Disney+ docuseries, <i>Rennervations.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGeqpWixm6%2BxKelnqpdqLavs9JmmJunpal6trrPq5ydoZOprqO1y6KrsmWfo3qttcWeZJqmlGLBqsDAp6CupV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
