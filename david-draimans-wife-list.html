They aren't very romantic, but they are patient and would never impose themselves on someone they didn't like. They are normally silent and keep their emotions hidden. Others find it difficult to understand them. When they lose their cool, it's like an explosion that scares people away.</p><p>People born on March 13 have a zodiac sign of <strong>Pisces</strong>. There would almost certainly be an image of Pisces next to the term "psychic" in the dictionary. Pisces is the zodiac's most perceptive, sensitive, and empathic sign, and that's because it's the last of the last. Pisces, as the final sign, has absorbed every lesson taught by the preceding signs, including the pleasures and sorrows, hopes and anxieties. It is represented as two fish swimming in opposite directions, symbolizing Pisces' continual divide of attention between imagination and reality.</p><p>Vocalist for the nu-metal band Disturbed, the group that released the 2000 album The Sickness, featuring the single “Down with the Sickness.” He married former WWE Diva Lena Yada.
