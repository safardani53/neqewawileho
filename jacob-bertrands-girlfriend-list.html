People born in the year of the dragon have adventurous and romantic souls. People struggle to comprehend a dragon's enigmatic personality. At the same time, they are unconcerned about issues that the typical person is concerned about. They may appear to be lethargic, but once they make a decision, they are more ambitious and aggressive than anybody else.</p><p>People born on March 6 have a zodiac sign of <strong>Pisces</strong>. There would almost certainly be an image of Pisces next to the term "psychic" in the dictionary. Pisces is the zodiac's most perceptive, sensitive, and empathic sign, and that's because it's the last of the last. Pisces, as the final sign, has absorbed every lesson taught by the preceding signs, including the pleasures and sorrows, hopes and anxieties. It is represented as two fish swimming in opposite directions, symbolizing Pisces' continual divide of attention between imagination and reality.</p><p>Known for such roles as Henry in Marvin Marvin and the eponymous Kirby Buckets, he has also done voice work for the films Rise of the Guardians and Paranorman. In 2013, he played Charlie Murphy in the TV movie Jinxed. He was born in Los Angeles, California to Scott and Christina Bertrand.
