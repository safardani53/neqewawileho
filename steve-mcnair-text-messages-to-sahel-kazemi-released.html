She said she might need to go to a hospital because she could hardly breathe.</p><p>Police say texts show McNair had someone transfer her the money. Txts also show Kazemi meeting McNair at the Nashville condo where he was shot.</p><p>He asked her to leave the front door open for him.</p><p style=text-align:center></p><p style=text-align:center>Steve McNair mistresses Leah Ignagni, left, and Sahel Kazemi. Could Kazemi’s jealousy of Ignagni have fueled a downward spiral and led to a grisly murder-suicide?</p><p>In response to a CBS report questioning the results of the Nashville police investigation, the department released its information, and spokesman Don Aaron said “there has been nothing uncovered that suggests this is not a <a href=#>murder-suicide</a>.”</p><p>The CBS report Monday interviewed friends portraying Sahel Kazemi as happy and showed that she had about $2,500 in her account when she died.</p><p>Kazemi’s <a href=# rel=noopener>texts to Steve McNair</a> talk of her showing furniture she planned to sell to some people and how she was at a store “trying to fix” her cell phone.</p><p>McNair texted her to say he had someone transfer the money she needed. Kazemi later texted McNair three more times asking to be with him that night.</p><span style=display:none>&nbsp;</span>Steve, who was married to Mechelle McNair, said he was having trouble getting his sons to sleep. But McNair was seen then at a restaurant with friends.<p>Kazemi texted she was going to his condo. He texted back at 12:38 a.m. that he was on his way. Kazemi told him at 1:14 a.m. that the door was open.</p><p>The last text was at 2:23 with Kazemi saying, “I am going to the store.”</p><p>Police say the message received by McNair’s phone seemed oddly placed in the stream of messages and out of synch. A T-Mobile specialist told police it could be a service or technical problem that caused a delay in the message’s delivery.</p><p>Police also say the shift manager at the restaurant where Kazemi worked told officers something seemed to be bothering Kazemi on July 3. Sonya New asked Kazemi if everything was all right when a server told her of her DUI arrest July 2.</p><p>The manager also knew of Kazemi’s affair and asked about McNair’s divorce.</p><p>“And she (Sahel Kazemi) just rolled her eyes. New said at the end of the conversation, Kazemi said, “My life is just (awful) and I should end it.”</p><p>Kazemi asked if she could leave early and clocked out at 10:07 p.m.</p><p>The summary also includes new information from the woman Kazemi followed from McNair’s condo, suspicious that he was involved with someone else.</p><p>Police say Leah Ignagni confirmed she was dating McNair and recalled seeing a woman in a black Escalade parked outside his condo 2-3 weeks before the murder.</p><p>Ignagni said she saw the suspicious woman follow her and later saw the Escalade circling her block or parked outside her apartment a week or two later.</p><p>A 2007 black Escalade was co-registered both to Kazemi and McNair.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2lxX2Z9cL%2FTnq2eZZ2Yu6K10WarnrCkYrqmv9Kanp6rXam8br%2FAoZylZZuWx6a5yGapnqSVlsCmsI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
