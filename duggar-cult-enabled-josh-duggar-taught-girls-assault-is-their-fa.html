Girls, including Josh’s own victims, are taught that sexual assault is their own fault … and also, God’s will."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Many years before Josh Duggar was arrested and charged for the possession of child porn, he was already a predator.</p><p>As a teenager, Josh molested multiple young girls — we know that four victims were his sisters, and at least one was not.</p><p>Jim Bob his his crimes from law enforcement, paving the way for Josh to avoid change or accountability.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/11/jim-bob-pic.jpg><p>The Duggars are linked to the Institute in Basic Life Principles, known is IBLP.</p><p>The organization is known for producing religious seminars on their extreme Christian fundamentalism.</p><p>The brand is and remains a perfect fit for the Duggars.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/jim-bob-duggar-and-jeremy-vuolo-and-1024x645.png><p>IBLP was founded by the infamous Bill Gothard, who also created the Advanced Training Institute.</p><p>ATI is a faith-based home-school program that fuses some academics with religious instruction in place of a real education.</p><p>It was also in Gothard’s facility that Josh received "counseling" after confessing to molesting five young girls.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>It’s very much worth noting that, in 2014, Gothard had to step down after being accused of sexual harassment.</p><p>But he continued to work with the Duggars and other families, and denied the accusations.</p><p>Meanwhile, he had something of an infamous reputation within the cult — as all of the prettiest teenage girls were assigned to work with him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Gothard’s perverse ideas about gender and sexuality are intrinsic to the beliefs within the IBLP.</p><p>Men are said to be insatiable, horny beasts with no self-control when it comes to sex.</p><p>As such, women — whom we’re to believe have "no" sex drive — are entirely responsible for not "tempting" them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Deep down, it seems like IBLP do understand that the world sees their despicable views as those of a nefarious cult.</p><p>Because this is not quite how they present themselves to the outside world.</p><p>Thankfully, some of those who have escaped from ATI and IBLP have shared their horror stories, exposing the truth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Lara Smith, who escaped that extreme lifestyle but was raised within ATI, spoke to <a href=#>The New York Post</a>.</p><p>"A lot of abuse occurred" due to the group’s extreme teachings, she shared.</p><p>"With [abusers like] Josh," Lara shared, "the whole environment set him up for success in his disgustingness."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Lara Smith’s parents were Southern Baptists, and she grew up outside of Houston.</p><p>When she was 12, they fell into ATI and attending IBLP seminars.</p><p>It wasn’t long before Lara was sent to "serve" at training centers in Oklahoma, Indiana, and Michigan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"We were taught our bodies don’t belong to us," Lara reflected.</p><p>She explained that they were thought that, when it comes to their bodies, "They belong to God."</p><p>"And so in that realm, anything that happens, God wants it to happen," Lara recalled.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Another who escaped the cult, Heather Heath, reflected upon her own experiences.</p><p>Her parents began using ATI when she was 9 years old, though she had always been homeschooled.</p><p>As a teenager, she traveled from Connecticut to Oklahoma as her family became further immersed in the cult.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>ATI teaches real math and even some real science, but teaches Christianity alongside them in a way that supercedes other humanities subjects.</p><p>The goal is to indoctrinate students with the extreme fundamentalist views of IBLP without exposing them to new, "dangerous" ideas.</p><p>At training centers, girls like Lara and Heather attended "wisdom searches," a form of bible study.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>There was more to it than discussing particular verses within the bible and their insights.</p><p>These sessions also included revealing "sins," including sexual assault.</p><p>"If we had been assaulted," Heather explained, "we had to confess what we did that brought the assault on us."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Though Heather (unlike Lara) was not personally sexually assaulted during her time with the cult, she knew others who were.</p><p>She recalled when another teen girl confessed that her older brother had sexually abused her.</p><p>Heather shared that this was a relatively common experience.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Heather was told that she "wouldn’t understand" the other girl’s situation.</p><p>The reason given to her was that Heather did not have an older brother of her own whom she could "tempt."</p><p>"She was like, ‘No good Christian man will marry me because I’m not a virgin,’" Heather grimly recalled.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"I was like, ‘No, it is not not your fault if someone else hurt you,’" Heather described.</p><p>"And then I got locked in my room to pray about that," she revealed.</p><p>She was ordered to pray on the topic "because I was wrong," by cult standards.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Those who were sexually assaulted were strongly discouraged from reporting the abuse to anyone outside of their family.</p><p>There was a reason for this — an internal hierarchy known as the "Umbrella of Protection."</p><p>The idea is that God is at the top, followed by pastors, then by fathers, then by mothers, then by children.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"As long as you’re under [your] umbrella, the rain" — sin and temptation from the devil — "can’t touch you," Heather explained.</p><p>The natural conclusion of that mindset, of course, meant that disobedience to a parent or pastor has lifelong consequences.</p><p>"Every decision we encounter in life was basically a heaven-or-hell decision," Heather characterized.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>IBLP and ATI’s resource chart for counseling those who experienced sexual abuse was leaked in 2013.</p><p>In the documents, it’s made clear that the victim is the wrongdoer for "defrauding" their abuser.</p><p>"Immodest dress, indecent exposure, being out from protection of our parents," are all reasons that God "let it happen," the chart describes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Lara Smith also shared how these toxic ideas were drilled into them.</p><p>"You need to be very careful what you do, what you say, what you wear, how you act," she recalled being taught.</p><p>Lara explained "because at any moment, you could trigger a boy, basically."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"There’s absolutely no personal responsibility for the boys," Lara characterized.</p><p>When she was 17, a 21-year-old maintenance staffer began to sexually assault her on a nightly basis, using his master key to enter her room.</p><p>Having never been taught about consent or bodily autonomy, Lara explained: "I didn’t have the capacity to say, ‘Hey, I don’t like it.’"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Lara and her father were contacted by Bill Gothard, who was viewed as "basically God" within the cult.</p><p>He had learned about the assaults, possibly from a friend of hers.</p><p>Lara expected a reprimand for "defrauding" the man. What she got was somehow worse.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"[Gothard] wanted the dirty details," Lara described. "He started asking the creepiest questions."</p><p>She detailed: "He was like, ‘What time did he kiss you?’ and ‘What time did he put his hands here?’ and ‘Did he do this to you?,’"</p><p>Lara’s parents never spoke to her about the assault again, she was never offered help, and her assailant was never punished.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Lara and Heather were both able to leave the horrors of IBLP behind in early adulthood.</p><p>Lara’s parents also left.</p><p>Heather’s mother left, but her father is still following the cult’s teachings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Unfortunately, being raised in such an extreme and harmful environment has done lifelong damage, though both women are in their 30s.</p><p>"My sense of bodily autonomy is still really messed up," Lara admitted.</p><p>"To this day, there’s people like me who aren’t totally convinced we were abused," she shared. "But we were."</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tpX2WCcLDUoJ6aql2Ywq3AjJ6lmpqcmrFuts6sn2acpZy0or6MrZiun5ipeqi10aWqZpmjqK62uNNmoKxlpJ2yqr6Mn5ho</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
