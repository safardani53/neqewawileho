Let's find out!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why does Selena's voice sound different in 'Only Murders in the Building'?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>After the first season dropped, several fans took to Reddit to discuss Selena's voice in Only Murders.</p><p>"Does anyone else think Selena Gomez’s voice sounds super weird in this show?" one Redditor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">asked</a>. "I compared back to her Wizards of Waverly Place days, and her voice sounds SO different! Just me, or did anyone else notice this?"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The post received multiple comments, with many fellow Redditors saying it could have to do with her age. Selena has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">grown up a lot</a> since Wizards, and we all know that as we get older, our voices continue to change and deepen over the years.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While some were bothered by the fluctuation is Selena's voice, others compared it to TV icon Madeline Kahn's, to which they said was "a compliment [because] Madeline is a classic." And after watching an old episode of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, we concur Selena's voice in Only Murders in the Building starkly sounds like Madeline's.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>i love only murders in the building so much and i have grown to really enjoy selena gomez as an actor but for the love of god, WHY does she talk like this now??? WHY is that her voice??</p>— swarles barkley (@flickerandfade) <a href=#>July 13, 2022</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Another reason Selena's voice might also sound different in Only Murders is because of <a href=#>lupus.</a></p><p>In 2015, Selena confirmed that she was diagnosed with lupus. For those unaware, lupus is a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">chronic autoimmune disorder</a> that can "cause inflammation and pain in any part of your body," including one's skin, joints, kidneys, and heart. Many now assume it is her health condition that has also caused the <a href=#>change in her appearance</a> in Season 3.</p><p>According to a 2017 study published in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PLOS One</a>, researchers discovered that people with lupus had "significantly lower vocal intensity and harmonics to noise ratio, as well as increased jitter and shimmer" when speaking.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Selena has been open about her battle with lupus, calling it an "everyday struggle."</h2><p>Since her diagnosis, Selena has been candid about how her battle with lupus has affected her mental health.</p><p>"I experienced [body-shaming] with my weight fluctuation for the first time," the 29-year-old actress revealed on an episode of Raquelle Stevens's video podcast, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Giving Back Generation</a>. "I have lupus and deal with kidney issues and high blood pressure, so I deal with a lot of health issues, and for me, that’s when I really started noticing more of the body image stuff."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The "<a href=#>Look at Her Now</a>" singer added that while lupus doesn't directly affect her weight, the "combination" of all the different elements of her health struggles do.</p><p>"It’s the medication I have to take for the rest of my life — it depends on even the month, to be honest," she shared.</p><p>"So for me, I really noticed when people started attacking me for that. In reality, that’s just my truth. I fluctuate," Selena continued. "It depends what’s happening in my life. Right [it's totally out of my control], and that got to me big time. I think for me, that really messed me up for a bit."</p><p>New episodes of Only Murders in the Building premiere Tuesdays, only on Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLKtsc2aZKCnnZrHbsLOopqeZZ%2Bjubp5zK6pnZ2iqA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
