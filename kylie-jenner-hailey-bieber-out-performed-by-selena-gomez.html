I accidentally laminated my brows too much."</p><p>Shortly after, Kylie posted her own Instagram Story post featuring the words: "This was an accident????" over her eyebrows.</p><p>After that, she posted another story that showed her on a video call with <a href=#>Hailey</a>, as the gal pals put their faces so close to the cameras that their eyebrows took up the whole screen.</p><p>Fans were quick to point out the potential link between Kylie and Selena's brow-focused stories.</p><p>Under a TikTok accusing the pair of bullying, one critic wrote: "They are the mean girls ewwww."</p><p>Kylie quickly responded to the drama.</p><p>In the same comment section, she wrote: "This is reaching. No shade towards Selena ever and I didn't see her eyebrow posts!</p><p>"U guys are making something out of nothing. This is silly."</p><p>Selena herself then jumped in, responding to Kylie's note saying: "Agreed @kyliejenner. It's all unnecessary. I'm a fan of Kylie!"</p><p>Despite the pair clearing the air, many critics continued sharing their negative opinions.</p><p>On Reddit, one person responded to another asking if anyone viewed the incident as "bullying," stating: "I'm sorry but if Hailey is involved... it was most likely towards Selena. I don't buy their BS."</p><p>Another wrote: "I know enough about mean girls to know this type of stuff isn't a coincidence.</p><p>"Mean girls do petty, silly stuff like posting eyebrows to make fun of their target that just had an eyebrow mishap.</p><p>"It's always enough to where the target knows it's about them but just petty and small enough that the mean girls can deny it and act like the target is crazy for thinking that."</p><h2>THE FEUD</h2><p>Selena and Hailey's <a href=#>dislike for one another</a> dates back several years.</p><p>In 2018, the model married Selena's on-again, off-again ex-boyfriend <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a>.</p><p>Selena's fans took it upon themselves to brand Hailey a "homewrecker," noting the short distance between the two women's relationships with the Canadian-born pop singer.</p><p>Hailey later <a href=#>clarified</a>: "Let's put it this way: When he and I ever started, like, hooking up or anything of that sort he was not ever in a relationship. Ever. At any point."</p><p>She went on: "It's not my character to mess with someone's relationship.</p><p>"I would just never do that. I was raised better than that. I'm not interested in doing that and I never was."</p><p>Kylie and Hailey have been friends for quite some time.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Meanwhile, photos surfaced of Selena partying with the Hulu star's ex, <a href=#>Tyga</a>, in 2022.</p><p>The photos suggested that the pair <a href=#>left a club together</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/selena-gomez-celebrates-launch-rare-807572944.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/wow-skincare-makeup-go-hand-488946905.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/i-didn-t-notice-difference-806189367.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxYGWCdICVaKKypJmaequxzaecq2WYlratsdhmmaKdkpq%2FbrvUrWSpnaKbvLO5xJ1km7FdqLKtsc2aZKCnnZrHcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
