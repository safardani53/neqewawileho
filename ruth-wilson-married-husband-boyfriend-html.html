Wilson manages a very private personal life which keeps any possible relationship details under wraps. She does not have Instagram or Twitter either. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Speaking to&nbsp;Vanity Fair in September 2016, the&nbsp;Mrs Wilson star <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a> that people assume things about her&nbsp;private life based on photographs that are snapped with her co-stars. In that case, she addressed her dating rumors with&nbsp;Joshua Jackson, her&nbsp;on-screen ex-husband.</p><p>The actress explained that she preferred not to talk about her private life, which leads to assumptions and speculations.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>"You don't actually know if I'm single or not. You haven't asked that question, and I haven't told you that answer. I don't talk about it," Wilson said. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Rumored Relationships with Co-Stars</h2><p>Wilson's private life is just that — private. But despite that, the rumors of her dating her co-stars seem to be a never-ending tale.</p><p>Over the years, she has&nbsp;worked with renowned celebrities, including&nbsp;Jake Gyllenhaal,&nbsp;Jude Law,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Joshua Jackson</a>, and&nbsp;Johnny Depp. And thanks to the internet, she is linked with all of the mentioned actors.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Her dating rumors with&nbsp;Brokeback Mountain actor&nbsp;Gyllenhaal started swirling after the Golden Globe event in January 2015 when&nbsp;they&nbsp;reportedly were seen kissing and holding hands at an after-party. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-184 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Wilson, however, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">denied</a> the rumors with Gyllenhaal while speaking to&nbsp;The Guardian&nbsp;back in 2015.</p><p>"Are you asking if I’m dating Jake Gyllenhaal?" she asked the interviewer.&nbsp;“No.&nbsp;I’m not dating Jake Gyllenhaal."</p><p>She added, “Every man in any show I do, I get aligned with having a <a href=# rel=follow>relationship</a> with. It’s just people bored and trying to create a story. So if that’s what you are asking, just ask it. But no is the answer.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>A little over a year later, after making that statement, she was linked with another co-star. This time with her The Affair co-star and on-screen husband, Jackson.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>They were even <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">spotted</a> at East Village by paparazzi looking cozy in a drinking session that had lasted for eight hours.</p><p>But Wilson&nbsp;hit back at the reports, saying that people are making baseless assumptions about her private life during an interview with&nbsp;Vanity Fair. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-623 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>"People don't know what goes on in my private life, so they have to make conjecture from something that is photographed," she stated.</p><p>The speculations go way back to the early 2010s, too. The actress was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">spotted</a> with&nbsp;Sherlock Holmes actor Jude Law in March 2012,&nbsp; which had given rise to another rumor of dating.</p><p>In January 2015, she also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dismissed</a> the rumors of dating actor&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Johnny Depp</a>, with whom she had shared the screen in the 2013 film&nbsp;The Lone Ranger. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6fCtbSMsKClq5%2Bjeq6t0augnpxdncK0rsCnm2aan66zs7XEp5tnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
