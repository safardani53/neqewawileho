His name’s right there.</p><p>Paola then tagged her post: "#momtobe #homespa #proudofmypregnantbody #90dayfiance #babybump"</p><p>She’s a fitness model and she’s proud of her body.</p><p>Paola is in no hurry to cover up her curves, even if one of them is just a baby bump.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Naturally, Paola’s body-shamers weren’t done trying to scold her into hiding her body.</p><p>"Eeeeww," exclaimed a super mature critic. "Still seeking attention in most unflattering ways…."</p><p>"Save this type of photograph for your husband," demanded another. "And only your husband. Nothing worse than a thirsty pregnant woman. I really want to like you."</p><p>Really? In all of the things in the world, there’s nothing worse than a pregnant woman who’s unashamed of her body?</p><p>"Why the need to seek so much attention?" wrote another. "If you really were secure & didnt give a rats f–k you wouldn’t have to seek attention being half naked…just sayin."</p><p>She’s a fitness model, she cares about keeping her fans updated, and she’s a reality star.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>But Paola also has her genuine fans.</p><p>"I don’t think anything is wrong with you being naked and pregnant," wrote one defender.</p><p>That person continued: "Those who are asking about you wearing clothes are probably jealous."</p><p>"Who cares about clothes?" asked another. "Motherhood is beautiful and so are you!"</p><p>Another wasn’t technically a critic, but offered a very different sort of positive feedback: "Those tatas are getting huge!! I love it!!"</p><p>Charming.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"Wow !!! I guess Russ has really lightened up," commented another.</p><p>"Before he would have made a big fuss about you being in such a photo," that person noted. "Now he not only allows it but hes the one taking the photo !!!"</p><p>Yes, it looks like Russ has gotten past at least some of his weird hangups about Paola’s job.</p><p>"Omg! All these babies," wrote a commenter. "Yours, Karine with a rainbow baby, elizabeth, aziza."</p><p>Those are all 90 Day Fiance stars with 90 Day Fiance babies.</p><p>"Giant baby boom on TLC," the commenter continued. "Can’t wait to see them all lined up."</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Paola Mayfield: 90 Day Fiance Star’s Hottest Photos That Russ Doesn’t Want …</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2Z9cLzAqKOaZZ2Wxqe1xKWbZqubmsSmvtJmmaicqWLAqa3MnqmsZaeewal5wZqroayll3qjrcGyZJutnaV6sbTOraZo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
