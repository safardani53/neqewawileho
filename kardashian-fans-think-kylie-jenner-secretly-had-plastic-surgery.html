Still pretty."</p><p>On a popular <a href=#>Kardashian</a>-dedicated <a href=#>Reddit</a> board fans were having a similar discussion, speculating on the reasons behind Kylie's change in appearance.</p><p>One person commented: "Filler and botox filler and botox, over and over and over."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>A second fan wrote: "Kylie should’ve stopped at lip fillers. Rest, she didn’t need it at all. She’s a natural beauty and she actually looks way better without makeup."</p><p>While another Redditor added: "Kylie was a naturally gorgeous girl. So was Khloe."</p><p>They continued: "They jumped on the bandwagon with these fillers, with what seemed like the intention to look more like Kim."</p><h2>COPYING KIM</h2><p>Kylie's older sister <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a>, 42, seemed to have <a href=#>influenced many of Kylie's fashion choices</a> over the past week.</p><p>Whether using the ongoing&nbsp;<a href=#>Paris Fashion Week</a>&nbsp;or those attended by&nbsp;Kim in the past as an example, the makeup mogul has appeared to draw inspiration from, if not downright copy, her sister's previous fashion looks.</p><p><a href=#>The&nbsp;Kardashians</a>&nbsp;star recently wore an electric-blue Givenchy gown, which she paired with the&nbsp;<a href=#>controversy-begetting Givenchy noose-shaped neckless</a>, and a pair of pink boots.</p><p>The bright blue dress looked eerily similar to the neon blue long-sleeved&nbsp;<a href=#>Balenciaga</a>&nbsp;gown&nbsp;Kim wore to the 2022 Vanity Fair&nbsp;<a href=#>Oscar's After Party</a>.</p><p>Kylie's Maison Margiela bra, which she wore underneath a baby doll dress when she&nbsp;<a href=#>walked the runway for the high-fashion brand</a>, was nearly the same shape and nude color as the bra Kim donned for Fergie's M.I.L.F. $&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">music video</a>.</p><p>Even the blue velvet Schiaparelli evening gown the reality star wore during last summer's Paris Fashion Week bares a resemblance to the black Versace gown her older sibling wore during 2019's New York Fashion Week.</p><p>Kim seemed to be aware of Kylie's penchant for copying her style when she accused her younger sister of "coming for her throne."</p><h2>'JUST STOP'</h2><p>Earlier this week, Kardashian fans voiced that <a href=#>Kylie looks like she has 'aged 15 years'</a> after seeing unedited photos of her in Paris.</p><p>The mom-of-two wore a skintight black dress with&nbsp;<a href=#>a giant lion's head attached to it.</a></p><p>The incredibly lifelike male lion head, complete with a full mane, was sewn onto the bodice of Kylie's&nbsp;dress and she completed her outfit with a black and gold croc-skin bag.</p><p>However, despite the shocking addition to her black gown, many fans were more interested in the&nbsp;Kardashian&nbsp;star's face.</p><p>Posting an unedited picture of Kylie alongside a snap from her&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram</a>&nbsp;post, the author captioned their&nbsp;Reddit&nbsp;post: "People say she gets her face done like that so it looks good in photos…</p><p>"How is that possible when she looks terrible without altering the photos? this woman is 25 years old, so pitiful," they added.</p><p>Others quickly commented on the thread as one person said: "Omg this comparison is crazy lol she’s aged like 15 years."</p><p>Someone else wrote: "That's very sad, actually. She was such a pretty girl," while a third said: "I'll never get over how Kylie ruined her otherwise gorgeous face she looked stunning after a few tweaks, the rest went downhill fast."</p><p>A fourth fan commented: "I wish she would just stop, like we would all celebrate if she stopped," while another simply added: "25 ?!! Wooow."</p><p>A different Reddit user wrote: "What's also really sad is she doesn't even look good in the edited photo because of all those fillers and work she's had done. Sad."</p><p>Someone else begged: "Leave your face alone Kylie! you’re just making it worse!!!"</p><p>Another person claimed: "It blows my mind the fact that this chick is only 25 years of age. Me at 25, I was at the start of my prime. I had a babyyy face.</p><p>"She never gave her body, her face a chance to develop into real adult womanhood. Like at allll," they added.</p><h2>KYLIE'S CONFESSION</h2><p>Earlier this month,&nbsp;<a href=#>fans mocked Kylie</a>&nbsp;after she confessed to "face-tuning" her photos following mishaps.</p><p>The star has repeatedly been&nbsp;<a href=#>accused of "photoshopping" fails</a>&nbsp;but has not come clean about her editing in the past.</p><p>Kylie addressed her photo editing in an interview, which made its way onto&nbsp;<a href=#>TikTok</a>.</p><p>In the sit-down, she appeared to be responding to a question about taking good selfies and sharing her secrets with fans.</p><p>She replied: "Good lighting, a good filter, face-tune – I'm just kidding."</p><p>The mom-of-two went on: "And a good angle."</p><p>The video was shared on a Kardashian online forum, where fans ripped the star over her confession.</p><p>One critic commented: "Definitely not kidding lmao."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p><a href=#>Kylie has been called out</a>&nbsp;for her use of photoshop several times through the years.</p><p>In fact, she's faced backlash over rumored photoshop fails and&nbsp;<a href=#>accusations of plastic surgery.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/kylie-jenner-getting-make-done-790916143.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/francine-lewis-compare-790838066.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/kylie-jenner-topples-latex-cone-790634646.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvYmeBdX%2BXaKKaqpSWwKm1wKdkn5meqHq1tMinomajqaG2pnnJnqWnnaJiwKav0Z6rpbFdna6lec%2BlmKysmZh6tMHRoJyrsV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
