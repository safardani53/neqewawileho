Then the semi-finals were in Los Angeles from April 8 to 11. Finally, the finals were in Las Vegas from May 14 to 17.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Although the show isn't filmed live, people can watch the show being taped. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">My San Antonio</a>, people were allowed to grab tickets at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">On Camera Audiences</a> and watch everything take place first-hand at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Alamodome</a>.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">another Instagram post</a> from producers, the 2022 season of American Ninja Warrior started casting in October of the previous year.

The first five episodes, which take place in San Antonio, will feature six obstacles. The semi-finals will consist of four episodes and have 10 obstacles. Then the finals will have four challenges that the contestants will have to overcome. This last set takes place over four episodes.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>It's not exactly clear what the challenges for Season 14 will look like. But they will include things like the Warped Wall, Ring Toss, and Flying Bar. Only the top 30 to 35 contestants will advance to the semi-finals, and in order to do so, they must do one of three things:</p><ul><li>Complete all six qualifying obstacles</li><li>Have a quick qualifying time</li><li>Make it far enough on the course that they rank on the leaderboard</li></ul><p>However, there is an exception to this rule for women. The blog post mentions that in 2017, a rule was added to the competition that allows the top five ranking women to advance to the semi-finals regardless of where they place on the leaderboard. Then, the top 15 competitors who either complete all 10 of the final obstacles or get through as much as possible in the least amount of time will head to the National Final.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Here, the top two placing women, regardless of where they rank, will also make it to the National Final.
