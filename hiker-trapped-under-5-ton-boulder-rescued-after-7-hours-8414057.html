The mountains boast opportunities for visitors to experience solitude and stargazing underneath the night skies.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Although the mountains appear extremely rugged, they are actually quite fragile,” the Forest Service’s website shared. “Animal and plant life in the desert depend upon the limited water and soil resources in these mountains. For this reason, it is especially important for visitors to practice Leave No Trace principles in this wilderness.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">PEOPLE reached out to Inyo County Search and Rescue Monday for further comment about the rescue and the status of the injured hiker.&nbsp;<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5ieuKa%2BjK2pmqigmrFuwc2dnKtlZWLBsLqMm6aupJSav26%2BxKyarp2UYq6nwMSrZHBlmKTCs7%2BMcWtqbGBqhA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
