Officers and Nashville Fire Department personnel responded and located resident Kyle Jacobs, 49, deceased from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound in an upstairs bedroom/office. His death is being investigated as an apparent suicide,” the Metropolitan Nashville Police said in a statement to <a href=#>Variety</a> on Friday, February 17. “Mr. Jacobs’ wife, Kellie Pickler, reported that she awoke a short time earlier, did not see her husband, and began looking for him. After she and her personal assistant were unable to open the door to the upstairs bedroom/office, the assistant telephoned 911.”</p><p><a href=#>TMZ</a> first reported that an unidentified man committed suicide at the Nashville home of the country singer, 36. A rep for The Nashville Police Department told the outlet that they got a call in the afternoon about a man who shot himself on the American Idol alum’s property.</p><p>Pickler and Jacobs have <a href=#>been married since 2011</a> when the pair decided to <a href=#>elope in the Caribbean</a> after being <a href=#>engaged for less than a year</a>. The twosome went on to have their own <a href=#>reality show</a> titled I Love Kellie Pickler, which premiered on CMT in 2015. The series showcased their relationship.</p><p>While the couple were married for more than a decade, they did not have any children but were the proud parents of two dogs. In August 2020, the <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a> alum exclusively told<a href=#> Us Weekly</a> she was perfectly fine <a href=#>not having any children</a>.</p><p>“I love being Aunt Kellie and that is perfect for me,” Pickler confessed to Us joking that she needed “another drink” to consider expanding her family.</p><p>In January 2012, the “Best Days of Your Life” singer opened up about how “blessed” she was to have a partner like Jacobs.</p><p>“He is the best husband I ever had — come to think of it, he’s the only husband I’ve ever had!” she gushed to Parade at the time. “But on a serious note, he’s the prize. I don’t know why he picked me, but I’m glad he did.”</p><p>Jacobs was a songwriter and worked with many country musicians including his wife, <a href=#><strong>Tim McGraw</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Kelly Clarkson</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Darius Rucker</strong></a> and more. He is most well-known for cowriting <a href=#><strong>Garth Brooks</strong></a>’ song, “More Than a Memory.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Story still developing.</p><p>If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or considering suicide, call the <a href=#>988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline</a> at 988.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaknZyhtqZ5z6KapKSVp8ButNSsmZqmlGK4urjEZpuemZRirrV5k3JknZ2klratv44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
