But it's more common than you might think, according to <a href=#>gynaecologists</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, there isn't a quick fix for this annoying issue.</p><p>But identifying what could be the cause of it could help you make changes to minimise the likelihood of tummy discomfort bursting your post-coital bubble.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1. You have a bacterial imbalance</h2><p>According to ob-gyn Anna Cabec, your post-sex bloat could down to an imbalance or overgrowth in the <a href=#>natural bacteria in your vagina</a>.</p><p>Aside from causing tummy troubles, a bacterial imbalance can often be the culprit behind<a href=#> yeast infections like thrush</a> and bacterial vaginosis.</p><p>These types of irritating infections are often triggered by semen entering your vagina, as well as lubricants containing artificial ingredients.</p><p>Douching - washing out the inside of your vagina - can also tip the balance of your vaginal bacteria in the wrong direction, according to Dr Cabeca.</p><p>The gynaecologist recommended incorporating probiotics such as fermented foods like kimchi, sauerkraut, and kombucha into your diet to keep your vaginal bacteria healthy and balanced.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Health</h2></p><p>You might also want to avoid getting semen in your vagina and it's best to steer clear of lube that uses artificial ingredients, such as glycerin, parabens, and any kinds of flavors or fragrances, Dr Cabeca said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. Your hormones are to blame</h2><p>As is the case with a lot of changes within our bodies, <a href=#>hormones</a> could be the culprit behind your discomfort after a romp.</p><p>If you're on or about to get your period, it might explain why your tummy swells up when you're cuddling with your partner in post-orgasmic bliss.</p><p>Women's health expert Jennifer Wider, told <a aria-label="POPSUGAR (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">POPSUGAR</a>: "Oftentimes, women will experience bloating before and/or during menstruation, so if they have intercourse around that time of the month, it is likely to play a role."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. You have a tilted uterus</h2><p>A uterus that is tilted backwards is called a <a href=#>retroverted uterus</a>.</p><p>Sex can cause it to move and make contact with other organs surrounding it, causing pain and bloating as a result.</p><p>According to Dr Wider, "signs of a retroverted uterus are pain during sex and painful menstruation, but often it has no symptoms."</p><p>The only way to find out if you have a retroverted uterus is to get a pelvic exam.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. You have digestive issues</h2><p>If you have a history of digestive issued such as <a href=#>constipation</a>, <a href=#>irritable bowel syndrome</a> (IBS) or <a href=#>heartburn</a>, you unfortunately could be more prone to bloating after sex, according to Dr Wider.</p><p>Some IBS symptoms to watch out for include stomach pain or cramps - usually worse after eating - an uncomfortably full and swollen tummy, diarrhoea and constipation, <a aria-label="NHS guidance says (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NHS guidance says</a>.</p><p>The women's health expert suggested avoiding foods that will make you gassy, such as beans and legumes, in the first place to avoid those symptoms coming on after intimacy.</p><p>She recommended having some ginger if you're still bloated despite avoiding those foods, as <a href=# aria-label="studies have shown (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">studies have shown</a> that the zingy root can bring down tummy pain and swelling.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. You're having unprotected sex</h2><p>Unprotected sex could be the reason you're experiencing cramps and bloating afterwards.</p><p>According to Dr Wider, if <a href=#>semen</a> enters your vagina, a type of lipid found in semen called prostaglandin can cause uterine contractions and discomfort, which may include bloating.</p><p>You can avoid this by using a condom during sex or by having your partner pull out before ejaculating.</p><p>That being said, be wary of using the <a href=# aria-label="'pull-out' method (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">'pull-out' method</a> as a means of contraception, as sperm can still enter your vagina regardless and most men don't withdraw quick enough.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>6. You have a latex allergy</h2><p>According to Dr Cabeca, having protected sex could ALSO be the culprit behind your post-romp bloat if you have a latex allergy, which can result in inflammation.</p><p>Symptoms of the allergy will vary from person to person, and some might have an immediate reaction to latex while other might show signs of it later.</p><p>A mild reaction could take the form of itchy eyes, sneezing or a runny nose, or an itchy rash, while other people may have a severe allergic reaction called&nbsp;anaphylaxis, according to <a href=# aria-label="NHS guidance (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">NHS guidance</a>.</p><p>You can buy latex-free condoms and it's advised you speak to a doctor if you think you have a latex allergy.</p><p>Whatever the cause of your bloating, it should go down on its own after a few hours.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>If it doesn't, or if you experience it consistently, Dr Wider recommended you speak to a doctor about it.</p><p>Nutritionist Rhiannon Lambert recently told The Sun <a href=#>three foods to avoid</a> if you want stave off gas and bloating.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57x56YpayYZIVzgI9yaWpnl667orHCqKOon5mowW6%2BxJqqqKajYsawwYybo6iZpGKup8DEq2Ssnahir6Kv056popldqsGqecibqmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
