Although Cher’s fervent admirers wholeheartedly backed her, some argued that she was incomparable.</p><p>The artificial rivalry between the two singers started when a Dua Lipa fan account referred to her as “our generation’s Cher.” The user included a video of the two singers dressed similarly and acting similarly.&nbsp;The video has been seen over a million times since the tweet was reposted across many accounts. It should be noted, however, that this isn’t the first time Dua Lipa has been likened to the If I Could Turn Back Time singer. When Lipa wore a Swarovski-covered custom-made Versace gown with a huge butterfly on the bodice in 2021, she was likened to Cher’s 1974 appearance by various people.</p><p>The comparison was also included in the previously stated video.&nbsp;During a 2018 Paris performance, Dua paid tribute to Cher by wearing her classic Bob Mackie nude dress with feathers and the word “Believe” on it. The 76-year-old donned the gown at the Met Gala in 1974.&nbsp;Versace, the fashion company, has also collaborated with the performers. Dua has selected the face of the premium brand in June 2021, according to Paper Magazine. This summer, Cher collaborated with the Italian design business to launch her own brand, Chersace.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Dua-Lipa-1.jpg alt=Cher width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Netizens respond to Dua Lipa being dubbed the “Cher of Our Generation.”</h2><p>The tweet’s objective was to complement both singers, but Cher fans argue that Dua Lipa hasn’t had the same impact on the music business as Cher.
